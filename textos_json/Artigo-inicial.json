A\nscientific characterization was performed by systematically searching the literature following PRISMA\nguidelines and registered in the OSF. The search was conducted across five databases (IEEE, Scopus,\nPubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) to identify the applications of the devices tracked in the market.\nThe searches were conducted between January and August 2025. A total of 5,071 records were analyzed;\n3,741 were unique entries. Among these, 2,087 studies explicitly reported the use of brain devices in clinical\ntrials, dataset development, or technology evaluations, resulting in a true positive rate of 55.79%. Research\nadoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications referencing each device. The Epoc X\nleads the number of research publications with 19.30%, followed by the OpenBCI system with 4.81%, and the\nMindWave with 4.06%. Enobio appears in fourth place with 2.89% and g.Nautilus ranks eighth with 1.71%.\nThese findings demonstrate a global effort by researchers to conduct accessible studies using user-friendly,\nlow-cost, and widely available devices, revealing a significant gap between consumer-grade and research-\ngrade technologies. The compiled dataset provides an evidence-based framework to guide neuroscientists,\nengineers, and clinicians in selecting the appropriate device for their specific research needs. This work\nalso identifies critical trends, such as the strong convergence toward wireless architectures and the growing\nemphasis on open data interfaces.\nINDEX TERMS Biomedical Instrumentation, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Electroencephalography (EEG),\nFunctional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), Wireless Neurotechnology.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA\nDVANCES in neurotechnology have profoundly trans-\nformed the field of neurorehabilitation, enabling tar-\ngeted stimulation of neuroplasticity, data-driven clinical\ndecision-making, and continuous monitoring of brain activity\nin both laboratory and real-world settings. These systems\nintegrate sensor-based monitoring, signal processing, and\ncomputational modeling to generate objective indicators of\nbrain function, enhancing the precision, reproducibility, and\npersonalization of therapeutic interventions. The emergence\nof portable, wireless, and cost-effective brain monitoring de-\nvices has further democratized access to neuroscience tools,\nallowing the acquisition of high-quality neural data under\necologically valid and movement-rich conditions that better\nreflect functional behavior in daily life.\nAmong noninvasive neuroimaging modalities, electroen-\ncephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spec-\ntroscopy (fNIRS) have become fundamental in both clini-\ncal and experimental neuroscience. EEG records electrical\npotentials with high temporal resolution, providing direct\ninsight into neuronal dynamics and oscillatory activity. Its\nportability, affordability, and compatibility with wearable ar-\nchitectures make it particularly suitable for neurofeedback\nand brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. In con-\ntrast, fNIRS measures hemodynamic changes associated with\ncortical activation by detecting oxygenation-dependent ab-\nsorption of near-infrared light. Although it provides lower\ntemporal resolution than EEG, fNIRS achieves higher spatial\nVOLUME 11, 2023\n1\nPage 4 of 202",

When combined, EEG and fNIRS offer complementary\ninformation—temporal precision and hemodynamic speci-\nficity—creating multimodal platforms capable of character-\nizing the neural mechanisms underlying movement, learning,\nand recovery.\nIn neurorehabilitation, these multimodal monitoring sys-\ntems enable quantification of functional recovery and opti-\nmization of individualized therapy programs. They support\nclosed-loop neurofeedback by providing brain-derived real-\ntime metrics that guide adaptive training and promote cortical\nreorganization after neurological injury. When embedded in\nimmersive or gamified environments, such systems enhance\nengagement and motivation, bridging neuroscience and reha-\nbilitation engineering. The resulting datasets not only inform\nclinical decisions but also contribute to large-scale neuro-\nphysiological research through standardized and reproducible\nacquisition protocols.\nDespite their growing potential, selecting the most appro-\npriate brain monitoring device remains a major challenge.\nThe commercial landscape has expanded rapidly, encompass-\ning numerous manufacturers and models with heterogeneous\ntechnical specifications, including differences in signal qual-\nity, channel count, electrode or optode design, wireless archi-\ntecture, data accessibility, and integration capabilities. This\ndiversity, coupled with the absence of standardized technical\nreporting, hinders direct comparison between systems and\ncomplicates the alignment of device performance with spe-\ncific experimental or therapeutic goals. As a result, decision-\nmaking often becomes complex and time-consuming, resem-\nbling the paradox of choice, where an excess of alternatives\nmay obscure optimal selection.\nTo address this challenge, the present work provides a com-\nprehensive global mapping and technical characterization of\ncommercially available EEG and fNIRS systems relevant\nto neuroscience and neurorehabilitation research. Based on\nan extensive analysis of manufacturer documentation, tech-\nnical manuals, patents, and secondary literature, the study\nconsolidates engineering and biomedical data into a unified\napplication-oriented framework. The proposed classification\ndetails operational parameters such as sampling rate, resolu-\ntion, connectivity, and mobility, while considering practical\naspects of usability, interoperability, and translational poten-\ntial.\nBy integrating these dimensions, this review offers a\ndecision-support framework to guide scientists, engineers,\nand clinicians in selecting brain monitoring technologies that\nare best suited to their methodological and operational re-\nquirements. Ultimately, its goal is to strengthen the interface\nbetween biomedical engineering and clinical neuroscience,\naccelerating the translation of portable brain monitoring sys-\ntems into real-world neurorehabilitation contexts and advanc-\ning the development of evidence-based neurotechnological\npractice.\nII. BACKGROUND\nSeveral studies have directly addressed the scope of this work,\nproviding relevant findings and insights. According to [1],\nEEG remains a preferred modality in neuroscience and BCI\nresearch due to its widespread familiarity and high temporal\nresolution, which makes it particularly suitable for appli-\ncations such as mental state classification, motor imagery,\nbrain–computer interfaces, robotic control, and neuroadap-\ntive games.\nReference [2] conducted a standardized comparison of six\nEEG systems, isolating signal quality from classifier per-\nformance. The active gel-based system achieved the highest\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), followed by a passive gel system,\nwhile other passive and dry electrode systems exhibited re-\nduced performance because of design and contact limitations.\nThe Saline-based electrodes showed the lowest signal quality.\nDespite lower SNR, wireless and dry systems are often fa-\nvored in short-term or user-oriented contexts for their comfort\nand usability. For clinical or high-performance BCI applica-\ntions, high-end systems remain the most reliable, though mid-\nrange commercial devices may offer a cost-effective balance\nof signal quality and operational flexibility.\nA study summarizes general technical specifications for\nsix EEG devices and notes that several studies have em-\npirically evaluated the effectiveness of these wearable neu-\nrotechnologies in fundamental research and BCI applications\n[3]. Reference [4] presents a comprehensive review of driver\ndrowsiness detection systems, examining 24 EEG-based tech-\nnologies that use physiological brain signals to determine\ndrowsiness and wakefulness.\nAn overview of wireless EEG hardware is provided by\n[5]. This comprehensive survey includes 48 wireless EEG\ndevices, outlining key features and specifications to enable\nside-by-side comparisons and support informed hardware se-\nlection. Additionally, it reviews 110 publications that em-\nployed wireless EEG, categorizing them by application and\nanalyzing factors such as the devices used, number of chan-\nnels, sample sizes, and participant mobility. Complementing\nthis analysis, the paper provides background information and\ncritical commentary on the challenges and considerations\ninherent to wireless EEG research, offering valuable insights.\nAs noted by [6], BCIs enable brain–device communica-\ntion, typically via EEG. Common systems range from single-\nchannel dry electrodes for targeted monitoring to saline-based\ndevices offering broader functionality. Lightweight multi-\nchannel setups are preferred for comprehensive recordings,\nwhile headband-style devices are often used in gaming and\nsleep assessments. Dry electrodes are generally favored over\nwet ones due to reduced setup time and improved comfort.\nDevice selection depends on the application and critical pa-\nrameters such as sampling rate, resolution, battery life, and\nelectrode count.\nAccording to [7], wet EEG devices—research/clinical-\ngrade systems with 32 to 256 channels, costing tens of\nthousands of dollars—offer high signal stability and sup-\nport advanced analyses, making them suitable for lab-\n2\nVOLUME 11, 2023\nPage 5 of 202",

These sys-\ntems are scalable and provide reliable raw data access,\nthough algorithm availability is limited. In contrast, dry\nsystems—consumer/research-grade, priced under a few thou-\nsand dollars—offer 1 to 64 channels, minimal setup time\n(up to 10 minutes), and do not require hair washing. They\nprovide moderate to high comfort and, despite variable signal\nstability, are wireless and support hyperscanning recordings,\nmaking them well-suited for real-world applications.\nConsumer-grade EEG systems generally perform well un-\nder high-SNR conditions, such as event-related potential\n(ERP) paradigms, but often underperform in real-world, low-\nSNR environments. Signal quality assessments indicate that\nresearch-grade systems and a greater number of sensors yield\nmore reliable data in mobile contexts. These findings suggest\nthat, for studies in naturalistic settings, consumer-grade de-\nvices may be insufficient, and further advancements in dry\nelectrode technology are needed to ensure adequate signal\nquality [8]. Reference [9] conducted a large-scale review of\nthe technical specifications of 16 wireless EEG systems from\nmultiple manufacturers. The study shows a comparative anal-\nysis of key features, underscoring the increasing accessibility\nand formal classification of wireless EEG technologies.\nAnother study [10] presents a table of 31 devices focused\non measuring brain activity related to the central nervous\nsystem, highlighting key market players and their most rep-\nresentative products. Reference [11] classifies 22 brain mon-\nitoring devices based on their primary applications: executive\nfunction, psychomotor skills, and behavioral, emotional, and\nsensory domains. Study selection and analysis were system-\natically conducted following the PRISMA-ScR framework.\nReference [12] reports the development of a low-cost EEG\nsystem and compares commercial devices ranging from USD\n300 to 50,000. High-end prices reflect regulatory certifica-\ntions required for clinical use, which are often unnecessary\nfor non-clinical BCIs. The limited availability of afford-\nable, high-quality options leads researchers to rely on costly\nclinical-grade systems. As costs scale with channel count,\nreducing electrode number and optimizing spatial placement\ncan improve cost-efficiency without compromising perfor-\nmance.\nPassive EEG electrodes transmit signals directly to the\namplifier, while active electrodes incorporate a preamplifier.\nReliable recordings require stable electrode–scalp contact,\nshielding against electromagnetic interference, and consistent\nsignal acquisition. Improved contact enhances noise identifi-\ncation and data reliability, potentially reducing the required\nsample size (n). Skin impedance decreases from ∼200 kΩ\n(uncleaned) to ∼120 kΩ(cleaned), with further reduction\nachievable through exfoliation or alcohol application at the\nelectrode site [13].\nWet EEG electrodes with gel provide low impedance\n(<10 kΩ) but require skin preparation, electrolyte applica-\ntion, and cleaning. Signal quality declines as the gel dries,\nlimiting its suitability for non-clinical use. Saline-based elec-\ntrodes offer an alternative but may irritate abraded skin and\npromote oxidation, reducing lifespan [13], [14]. Dry elec-\ntrodes enable faster setup; although impedance is higher, ad-\nvanced algorithms reduce noise and artifacts. Well-designed\ndry systems combining optimized materials, placement, and\nshielding can achieve signal quality comparable to wet sys-\ntems [14], [15], [16], [17]. Silver electrodes coated with silver\nchloride (Ag/AgCl) remain the gold standard due to their\ncorrosion resistance [18].\nFurthermore, low-cost EEG modules, typically compatible\nwith open-source development platforms, have emerged as\naccessible alternatives for initial investigations, educational\npurposes, and non-clinical research. However, their limited\nfunctionality and susceptibility to noise constrain their use in\nhigh-precision applications [19].\nThe common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of driven right\nleg (DRL) circuits is essential for minimizing common-mode\nnoise in biopotential recordings. DRL systems operate by\ninverting the common-mode voltage, detected via a common-\nmode sense (CMS) electrode, and feeding it back to the partic-\nipant through the DRL electrode. This negative feedback re-\nduces interference at the amplifier inputs, enhancing CMRR\nand signal fidelity. Combined, CMS and DRL improve noise\nrejection and overall recording reliability [20].\nThe lab streaming layer (LSL) enables precise multimodal\nsynchronization without hardware triggers, supporting seam-\nless integration with platforms such as MATLAB, Python,\nOpenViBE, BCI2000, and Unity. It synchronizes EEG, video,\nperipheral sensors, and stimulus markers for real-time appli-\ncations, enhancing interoperability and scalability in research\n[21].\nThe fNIRS measures cortical oxygenation and blood flow\nup to ∼15 mm depth using red and near-infrared light. Emit-\nted light penetrates the scalp and skull, interacts with brain\ntissue, and is detected by infrared sensors positioned a few\ncentimeters away. Absorption patterns, influenced by changes\nin hemoglobin saturation, allow inference of cortical activity.\nRed light is primarily absorbed by oxygenated hemoglobin,\nwhile near-infrared light reflects total blood concentration.\nShort source–detector separations minimize contamination\nfrom superficial tissues, enhancing signal specificity [22].\nLatency, response time, jitter, and throughput are key per-\nformance metrics in wireless EEG and fNIRS systems, influ-\nencing reliability and real-time operation. Latency is the delay\nfrom neural or hemodynamic activity to its digitized signal;\nresponse time adds processing delays. Jitter, or variability in\nthese times, reduces temporal precision, while throughput,\nthe rate of successful data transmission, often trades off with\nlatency. Optimizing these metrics is essential for temporal\nresolution, data integrity, and real-time responsiveness [23],\n[24], [25], [26].\nBrain monitoring devices increasingly integrate multi-\nmodal biosensors, including electrocardiography (ECG),\nphotoplethysmography (PPG), pulse oximetry, and blood\npressure for cardiovascular monitoring; electromyography\n(EMG) and electrooculography (EOG) for neuromuscular\nVOLUME 11, 2023\n3\nPage 6 of 202",

Galvanic skin response (GSR) and thermal\nsensors track skin conductance and temperature, while some\nsystems add eye tracking and light-based neuromodulation,\nsuch as transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) and near-\ninfrared photobiomodulation (NIR-PBM).\nIII. METHOD\nThis scoping review employed a structured documentary ap-\nproach to identify and characterize commercially available\nbrain-monitoring devices. Data were collected from both pri-\nmary scientific literature and secondary sources, including\npatents, user manuals, and manufacturer websites. Devices\nwere included based on the following criteria: (i) noninvasive\nneurotechnologies; (ii) portable form factor suitable for clin-\nical or field use; (iii) commercial availability in the global\nmarket; (iv) sold as complete bundled systems rather than\nmodular components; and (v) demonstrated or potential rele-\nvance to neuroscience and neurorehabilitation applications.\nTo define the technological scope of the review, MeSH\ncategories were consulted. “Diagnostic Techniques and Pro-\ncedures” was selected as the overarching classification\nencompassing brain-monitoring modalities across the tar-\nget databases. Identified technologies included EEG, HEG,\nNIRS, fNIRS, PET, MEG, MRI, and fMRI. However, the\nfinal analysis focused exclusively on noninvasive, portable,\nand wireless EEG and fNIRS devices.\nDatabase searches were conducted from March to August\n2025 across five platforms: IEEE Xplore, PubMed/MEDLINE,\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Embase. Each search employed\na Boolean query combining device name, manufacturer, and\ntechnology terms (e.g., “device” AND “manufacturer” AND\n“EEG/fNIRS”). Queries were adapted to the syntax and\nindexing structure of each database. IEEE Xplore was used\nfor engineering and hardware design; PubMed/MEDLINE for\nits coverage of biomedical literature; Web of Science and Sco-\npus for multidisciplinary indexing and citation tracking; and\nEmbase for its emphasis on medical devices and international\ncontent.\nThe number of DOI-indexed publications referencing each\nidentified device was recorded to assess research use. No lan-\nguage or date restrictions were applied. Pricing information,\nwhen available, was collected in U.S. dollars, with currency\nconversion applied as needed. In cases where prices were\nnot publicly disclosed, some manufacturers were contacted\ndirectly. However, the prices are not presented to respect\nconfidentiality and variation in purchasing terms.\nA summary table was compiled for all eligible devices, in-\ncluding technical parameters such as the number of channels,\nelectrode type, sampling rate, data connectivity, software\navailability, and intended application. Additionally, peer-\nreviewed articles reporting experimental or clinical use of\neach device were identified to verify relevance, deployment,\nand impact across neuroscience and biomedical engineering\ndomains.\nThe protocol of this scoping review was prospectively\nregistered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) under the\nregistration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/EMRH8.\nIV. RESULTS\nA total of 5,071 records were retrieved from the selected\nscientific databases based on the inclusion criteria. After\nremoving 1,331 duplicates (26.25%), 3,741 unique records\nremained. Of these, 2,087 studies explicitly reported the use\nof brain monitoring devices in clinical trials, dataset develop-\nment, or technological assessments, yielding a true positive\nrate of 55.79%. Eighty records (2.14%) were excluded due\nto a lack of access. Supplementary technical information was\nobtained from manufacturers’ websites and consolidated in\nTable 1, comprising 96 devices, 125 when including model\nvariants. Research adoption was quantified by the number\nof DOI-indexed publications referencing each device. No\ncritical appraisal of individual sources of evidence was per-\nformed, as this scoping review aimed to map the extent and\nnature of the literature without assessing study quality.\nA.

Devices\nwith extensive literature typically exhibit well-characterized\nsensor geometries and analog front-ends, enabling informed\ntechnical decisions on montage, preprocessing (bandpass,\nnotch, referencing), artifact modeling (ICA templates, motion\nregression), and synchronization requirements for ERP or\nclosed-loop paradigms. However, a high publication count\ndoes not eliminate methodological risks: firmware or driver\nupdates, raw data access policies, and reliance on proprietary\npipelines may introduce systematic biases and affect inter-\nsite reproducibility. These factors require authors to report the\nfirmware version and exact acquisition conditions.\nSome models are frequently cited (often due to accessi-\nbility and cost), while others show few or no reported ap-\nplications, indicating a lack of independent validation. For\nstudies requiring statistical robustness and reproducibility\n(e.g., clinical ERP, connectivity analyses), selecting devices\nwith substantial prior use reduces measurement bias risk.\nIn exploratory or prototyping contexts, devices with limited\npublications may still be valuable if accompanied by tech-\nnical validation (pilot SNR, dropout, latency) and explicit\ndiscussion of generalization limits, as low study counts may\nreflect novelty or barriers such as cost, licensing, or raw data\navailability.\nSampling rates across these devices reflect their intended\napplications. Consumer-grade and low-power BCI headsets\noften operate at 86–250 Hz, sufficient for basic cognitive and\naffective studies. Most research-oriented systems, however,\nsample between 250 Hz and 1 kHz, supporting standard\nERP, spectral, and time–frequency analyses without aliasing.\nA few multimodal platforms push sampling rates up to 16\nkHz to capture high-frequency EEG or evoked potentials\nwith millisecond precision, though this comes with increased\ndemands for data storage and transmission.\nBit depth is another critical differentiator. Lower-cost units\ntypically employ 12–14-bit ADCs, adequate for classroom\ndemonstrations or basic neurofeedback. Mid-tier research\nsystems almost universally provide 16-bit resolution, offering\na robust SNR for most experimental paradigms. Premium\ndevices feature 24-bit or even 32-bit converters, minimizing\nquantization noise and maximizing dynamic range for de-\ntecting subtle oscillatory phenomena or conducting source\nlocalization.\nConnectivity options mirror trade-offs between mobility\nand data throughput. Bluetooth dominates the entry and mid-\nrange segments, enabling wireless operation at sampling rates\nup to 1 kHz with latencies suitable for BCI control or ambula-\ntory monitoring. A smaller subset of systems supports Wi-Fi\nstreaming, which is essential for multi-subject experiments\n(hyperscanning).\nSoftware support is a major consideration beyond hard-\nware specifications. Approximately 70–80% of devices in-\nclude their own acquisition and visualization suites; more\nadvanced systems supplement this with Python, MATLAB, or\nLabVIEW SDKs, enabling custom preprocessing, real-time\nartifact rejection, and precise synchronization with stimuli\nor other biosignals. Entry-level headsets may only permit\naudio-based triggers or manual markers, adequate for broad\ncognitive tasks but insufficient for high-precision studies or\nclosed-loop neuromodulation.\nBased on a renowned manufacturer whose devices are\nwidely recognized in research, the cost of EEG systems varies\nsignificantly with the number of channels, which directly\naffects spatial resolution and the range of clinical or research\napplications. Lower-channel systems, such as 8-channel de-\nvices, are priced around $6,000 (USD), making them suitable\nfor basic monitoring tasks, educational use, or preliminary\nresearch. As channel count increases, so does the system’s\ncomplexity and capabilities, resulting in higher costs. For\ninstance, a 16-channel EEG device is priced at approximately\n$14,000, while a 32-channel system costs about $24,000.\nHigh-density EEG systems with 64 channels offer superior\nspatial resolution and advanced signal acquisition but are sub-\nstantially more expensive, often exceeding $50,000. These\nprice differences highlight the trade-offs between cost, signal\nquality, and application scope, underscoring the importance\nof selecting a system that aligns with the project’s specific\nneeds and budgetary constraints.\nRegarding devices with electrode caps, the choice of base\nmaterial is critical. Densely woven meshes and thick fabrics,\nsuch as neoprene, may cause discomfort due to increased\nscalp pressure and heat retention, given the head’s sensitivity\nto temperature variations. Excessive or uneven pressure can\ndegrade signal quality by affecting the electrode–skin inter-\nface, increasing impedance, and introducing motion artifacts.\nFurthermore, sustained pressure may lead to thermal discom-\nfort and sweating, which can further impair conductivity.\nAsymmetrical pressure distribution may also introduce arti-\nficial asymmetries in the recorded data. Consequently, device\ndesign must prioritize ergonomic fit and material selection to\nensure user comfort while preserving signal integrity and data\nreliability.\nThe “Epoc X” device by Emotiv leads the number of\nresearch publications with 19.30%, followed by the Open-\nBCI system with 4.81%, and the “MindWave Mobile 2” by\nNeurosky with 4.06%. All three are consumer-grade models.\nIn fourth place appears the first research-grade device, the\nEnobio by Neuroelectrics, with 2.89%. The g.Nautilus by\ng.tec ranks eighth, representing 1.71% of usage in published\nresearch.\nThese findings demonstrate a global effort by researchers\nto conduct accessible studies using user-friendly, low-cost,\nand widely available devices, revealing a significant gap be-\ntween consumer-grade and research-grade technologies.\nIn summary, most rehabilitation-oriented neuroscience\nstudies will find an optimal balance in 16 to 32-channel\ndevices sampling at 1 kHz with 16-bit resolution, Bluetooth\nstreaming, and a user-friendly SDK. For laboratories with\ngreater demands for spatial resolution or multimodal record-\ning, premium systems—though more expensive and opera-\ntionally demanding—offer unparalleled data quality and flex-\n6\nVOLUME 11, 2023\nPage 9 of 202",

By understanding how hardware and software parame-\nters interact, researchers can select a brain monitoring system\nthat best balances spatial coverage, signal fidelity, mobility,\nand cost to meet their specific investigative goals.\nC. LIMITATIONS OF TECHNOLOGIES EVALUATED\nThe technologies applied in brain research have been funda-\nmental in enhancing our understanding of the nervous system\nand in developing interventions for neurorehabilitation. How-\never, their use comes with several limitations that can impact\ntheir effectiveness, applicability, and reach across different\ncontexts. These limitations span technical, economic, and\noperational aspects, all of which must be carefully considered\nin the development and implementation of these tools.\nFrom a technical perspective, key challenges include res-\nolution, accuracy, and response time. EEG, for example, of-\nfers excellent temporal resolution but lower spatial resolution\ncompared to fNIRS. Response time is particularly critical\nfor real-time applications such as neurofeedback and BCI\ndevelopment. Reliability is another concern, as noise and\nexternal interference can compromise data quality and reduce\nthe effectiveness of the methods. EEG measures electrical\nactivity from the cerebral cortex, but signal distortions occur\nas electrical potentials pass through the skull and scalp. These\nsignals range from approximately -90 mV at rest to 40 mV at\nthe peak of an action potential and require amplification, an\nessential step that can also introduce additional noise.\nNoise sources include improper electrode placement, oxi-\ndized or deteriorated electrodes, weak scalp attachment, poor\ncontact due to dry or oily skin, hair strands, dirt, and crusts.\nAdditional sources include movement artifacts from muscle\nactivity, blinking, heartbeats, and electromagnetic interfer-\nence caused by electrical transients, radio frequencies, and\ngrounding issues. Given these challenges, EEG devices re-\nquire meticulous electronic design, careful assembly, and cir-\ncuits for attenuating oscillating electromagnetic frequencies.\nConnections and circuits must be shielded, cables should\nbe short and shielded, and electrodes must be firmly and\nconsistently attached to the scalp. Even with these precau-\ntions, significant computational effort is needed to filter the\nresulting signals effectively.\nDue to the complex, non-stationary, and nonlinear charac-\nteristics of EEG signals, several systems have been developed\nfor data analysis. Signal complexity can be reduced using fast\nalgorithms, enabling machine learning methods to automat-\nically classify certain mental disorders with high accuracy.\nDisorders such as depression and epilepsy could be diagnosed\nat the same time. However, EEG-based diagnosis has limita-\ntions: patients may not exhibit abnormal patterns consistently,\nand short EEG recordings can miss critical events, leading to\ninaccurate results. While long-term monitoring improves the\ndetection of abnormalities, EEG signals are highly suscepti-\nble to external interference, and detecting periods of inactivity\nremains challenging [27].\nUsability and ergonomics are key factors that influence the\nadoption of these technologies. Sensors and devices can be\nuncomfortable during extended acquisition sessions, while\ncomplex interfaces and advanced technical requirements may\nlimit their use in clinical or home environments. The portabil-\nity of certain devices, such as brain imaging systems (fMRI\nor PET), is also constrained by their size and dependence\non specialized infrastructure, restricting their application to\nresearch centers or hospitals. Additionally, the high cost of ad-\nvanced technologies constitutes a barrier to their widespread\nimplementation.\nThe fNIRS faces challenges in distinguishing brain hemo-\ndynamic changes from artifacts caused by scalp hemodynam-\nics or movement. Photons detected by infrared receivers are\ninfluenced by physiological factors like respiration and heart\nrate, reducing contrast and spatial resolution. The technique\nalso suffers from low temporal resolution and SNR [28].\nEfforts to improve signal quality range from averaging mul-\ntiple readings to using advanced statistical models, but low\nsensitivity to deeper brain layers and the inherent statistical\nproperties of the signal complicate data interpretation [29].\nSome technologies are unsuitable for patients with metal\nimplants or cognitive impairments. Combining these tools\nwith conventional therapeutic approaches can be complex,\nparticularly when determining the clinical relevance of the\ndata collected. Ethical and privacy concerns related to brain\nand physiological data collection further complicate their\nadoption, necessitating stringent regulations to ensure user\ntrust and safety.\nThe EEG technology has advanced with the development\nof wireless systems, dry electrodes, and AI-driven data pro-\ncessing. Dry electrodes enhance usability by enabling faster\nand more accessible setups. While fNIRS is less affected\nby electromagnetic interference, its sensitivity is limited by\nthe slower hemodynamic response compared to the rapid\ntransmission of electrical signals in EEG. AI-enhanced multi-\nmodal fNIRS systems are approaching clinical-grade perfor-\nmance, although high costs remain a significant barrier.\nThe term research-grade quality is often used to describe\ndevices suitable for scientific studies but not meeting the\nstringent standards required for clinical use. In contrast, low-\ncost EEG modules, priced under fifty dollars, offer affordable\nalternatives. Commonly sold as do-it-yourself (DIY) kits,\nthese modules allow for customized assembly, making EEG\ntechnology more accessible. While they lack the advanced\nfeatures and precision of clinical-grade systems, they still\nprovide meaningful insights into brain activity.\nSoftware is often sold separately, significantly increasing\noverall costs. Commercial solutions typically start around\n$1,000, with advanced versions reaching up to $8,000. Tem-\nporary licenses, renewable subscriptions, and lite versions\nwith limited functionality are common, while open-source\nplatforms offer more accessible alternatives. Some systems\nare specifically designed for neurofeedback, with software\ntailored to training games. Increasingly, brain monitoring\ndevices integrate artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time data\nprocessing, anomaly detection, and rapid diagnostics.

Free access to AI-filtered\ndata is a valuable resource for the neuroscience community.\nSeveral brain equipment manufacturers offer either com-\nplete systems or modular components, allowing for user\ncustomization, though often without clear guidance for se-\nlection. Some companies, traditionally focused on wired\nsystems, have introduced wireless options, typically lim-\nited to amplifiers without caps. Others operate exclusively\nthrough rental or contracted services, while certain technolo-\ngies remain under development. Identified manufacturers in-\nclude Compumedics Neuroscan (AUS), fNIR Devices (USA),\nHitachi (JPN), Neurosoft (RUS), BioSemi (NLD), iCel-\nera (BRA), Contec (CHN), Meditron (BRA), Neurovirtual\n(USA), TechEn (USA), Imec (BEL), Kernel (USA), Mind-\nfield (DEU), NeuroPro (CHE), Gowerlabs (ENG), Neurotec\n(BRA), and Deymed (CZE). Additionally, low-cost module\nproviders include Deuteron (ISR) and Sichiray (CHN). In\nsome cases, websites are outdated or provide little evidence of\nongoing product availability, raising concerns about whether\nsome manufacturers are still active.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis review provides a comprehensive and technically\ngrounded synthesis of the current landscape of noninvasive\nbrain monitoring technologies, with emphasis on their appli-\ncability to neuroscience and neurorehabilitation. By system-\natically mapping the specifications, architectures, and oper-\national features of commercially available EEG and fNIRS\nsystems, the study translates complex engineering data into an\nactionable framework for device selection and experimental\ndesign. The proposed framework supports researchers and\nclinicians in aligning technical parameters with the specific\ngoals of their investigations, facilitating evidence-based, re-\nproducible, and methodologically sound use of neurotechno-\nlogical tools.\nThe analysis highlights that device selection should be\nguided primarily by the intended research or clinical ob-\njective. High temporal resolution and signal fidelity are\nessential for applications such as event-related potentials\nand functional connectivity analysis, whereas mobility, ease\nof deployment, and rapid setup are critical for field stud-\nies, BCI applications, and rehabilitation in movement-rich\ncontexts. Multimodal configurations, such as integrated\nEEG–fNIRS systems, further expand the potential for real-\ntime monitoring, neurofeedback, and closed-loop virtual re-\nality paradigms. Across modalities, core decision parameters\ninclude electrode or optode type, channel density, sampling\nrate, bit resolution, wireless transmission protocol, and data\naccessibility through standardized interfaces or SDKs.\nPractical trade-offs also emerge among systems. Wet and\ngel-based electrodes provide the highest signal quality but\nrequire time-intensive preparation, while dry and semi-dry\nelectrodes enhance usability and participant comfort at the\ncost of slightly increased impedance. Channel configurations\nbetween 8 and 32 are suitable for most BCI and connectivity\nstudies, whereas high-density arrays (≥64 channels) enable\nsource localization and advanced spatial analysis. Sampling\nrates between 250 and 500 Hz meet the majority of experi-\nmental demands, while higher rates (≥1 kHz) and 24-bit reso-\nlution are recommended for precision time-locked paradigms.\nReliable wireless connectivity—preferably low-latency Wi-\nFi for data-intensive applications and Bluetooth Low Energy\nfor mobile protocols—supports robust multimodal synchro-\nnization and integration with immersive environments.\nIn applied neurorehabilitation, integration with virtual re-\nality systems requires ergonomically optimized, low-latency\ndevices capable of sustaining high-quality signal acquisition\nduring motion. Systems equipped with open SDKs and native\nsynchronization libraries facilitate seamless communication\nwith VR engines, enabling adaptive neurofeedback and eco-\nlogical data capture. Dry electrode designs are particularly ad-\nvantageous in these contexts, improving participant comfort\nand reducing setup time while maintaining acceptable signal\nstability for most training and assessment scenarios.\nThe findings from the strong body of evidence in the\nscientific literature highlight a global movement toward in-\ncreasing the accessibility of neuroscience research through\nuser-friendly, affordable, and widely available devices, while\nalso underscoring the persistent gap that remains between\nconsumer-grade and research-grade technologies.\nThe compiled dataset provides an evidence-based frame-\nwork to guide neuroscientists, engineers, and clinicians in se-\nlecting the most appropriate device for their specific research\nneeds. This work also identifies critical technological trends,\nsuch as the strong convergence toward wireless architectures\nand the growing emphasis on open data interfaces.\nOverall, this study contributes a reproducible, evidence-\nbased technical mapping of EEG and fNIRS technolo-\ngies, consolidating information from scientific, industrial,\nand patent sources into a unified classification framework.\nBeyond informing device acquisition, these findings pro-\nmote greater interoperability, transparency, and standardiza-\ntion within the neurotechnology ecosystem. Future research\nshould expand the evaluation scope to include longitudinal\ndata quality, real-world reliability, and user experience met-\nrics, strengthening the translational bridge between engineer-\ning innovation and clinical neurorehabilitation. By doing so,\nthe field moves closer to developing adaptive, accessible, and\nscientifically validated neurotechnological platforms capable\nof transforming both neuroscience research and patient care.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge the support of CNPq and CAPES,\nwhose continued commitment to scientific research, educa-\ntion, and innovation in Brazil made this work possible.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y.

A\nscientific characterization was performed by systematically searching the literature following PRISMA\nguidelines and registered in the OSF. The search was conducted across five databases (IEEE, Scopus,\nPubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) to identify the applications of the devices tracked in the market.\nThe searches were conducted between January and August 2025. A total of 5,071 records were analyzed;\n3,741 were unique entries. Among these, 2,087 studies explicitly reported the use of brain devices in clinical\ntrials, dataset development, or technology evaluations, resulting in a true positive rate of 55.79%. Research\nadoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications referencing each device. The Epoc X\nleads the number of research publications with 19.30%, followed by the OpenBCI system with 4.81%, and the\nMindWave with 4.06%. Enobio appears in fourth place with 2.89% and g.Nautilus ranks eighth with 1.71%.\nThese findings demonstrate a global effort by researchers to conduct accessible studies using user-friendly,\nlow-cost, and widely available devices, revealing a significant gap between consumer-grade and research-\ngrade technologies. The compiled dataset provides an evidence-based framework to guide neuroscientists,\nengineers, and clinicians in selecting the appropriate device for their specific research needs. This work\nalso identifies critical trends, such as the strong convergence toward wireless architectures and the growing\nemphasis on open data interfaces.\nINDEX TERMS Biomedical Instrumentation, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Electroencephalography (EEG),\nFunctional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), Wireless Neurotechnology.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA\nDVANCES in neurotechnology have profoundly trans-\nformed the field of neurorehabilitation, enabling tar-\ngeted stimulation of neuroplasticity, data-driven clinical\ndecision-making, and continuous monitoring of brain activity\nin both laboratory and real-world settings. These systems\nintegrate sensor-based monitoring, signal processing, and\ncomputational modeling to generate objective indicators of\nbrain function, enhancing the precision, reproducibility, and\npersonalization of therapeutic interventions. The emergence\nof portable, wireless, and cost-effective brain monitoring de-\nvices has further democratized access to neuroscience tools,\nallowing the acquisition of high-quality neural data under\necologically valid and movement-rich conditions that better\nreflect functional behavior in daily life.\nAmong noninvasive neuroimaging modalities, electroen-\ncephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spec-\ntroscopy (fNIRS) have become fundamental in both clini-\ncal and experimental neuroscience. EEG records electrical\npotentials with high temporal resolution, providing direct\ninsight into neuronal dynamics and oscillatory activity. Its\nportability, affordability, and compatibility with wearable ar-\nchitectures make it particularly suitable for neurofeedback\nand brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. In con-\ntrast, fNIRS measures hemodynamic changes associated with\ncortical activation by detecting oxygenation-dependent ab-\nsorption of near-infrared light. Although it provides lower\ntemporal resolution than EEG, fNIRS achieves higher spatial\nVOLUME 11, 2023\n1\nPage 4 of 202\n\nAuthor et al.: Preparation of Papers for IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS\nlocation and greater robustness against electrical interfer-\nence. When combined, EEG and fNIRS offer complementary\ninformation—temporal precision and hemodynamic speci-\nficity—creating multimodal platforms capable of character-\nizing the neural mechanisms underlying movement, learning,\nand recovery.\nIn neurorehabilitation, these multimodal monitoring sys-\ntems enable quantification of functional recovery and opti-\nmization of individualized therapy programs. They support\nclosed-loop neurofeedback by providing brain-derived real-\ntime metrics that guide adaptive training and promote cortical\nreorganization after neurological injury. When embedded in\nimmersive or gamified environments, such systems enhance\nengagement and motivation, bridging neuroscience and reha-\nbilitation engineering. The resulting datasets not only inform\nclinical decisions but also contribute to large-scale neuro-\nphysiological research through standardized and reproducible\nacquisition protocols.\nDespite their growing potential, selecting the most appro-\npriate brain monitoring device remains a major challenge.\nThe commercial landscape has expanded rapidly, encompass-\ning numerous manufacturers and models with heterogeneous\ntechnical specifications, including differences in signal qual-\nity, channel count, electrode or optode design, wireless archi-\ntecture, data accessibility, and integration capabilities. This\ndiversity, coupled with the absence of standardized technical\nreporting, hinders direct comparison between systems and\ncomplicates the alignment of device performance with spe-\ncific experimental or therapeutic goals. As a result, decision-\nmaking often becomes complex and time-consuming, resem-\nbling the paradox of choice, where an excess of alternatives\nmay obscure optimal selection.\nTo address this challenge, the present work provides a com-\nprehensive global mapping and technical characterization of\ncommercially available EEG and fNIRS systems relevant\nto neuroscience and neurorehabilitation research. Based on\nan extensive analysis of manufacturer documentation, tech-\nnical manuals, patents, and secondary literature, the study\nconsolidates engineering and biomedical data into a unified\napplication-oriented framework. The proposed classification\ndetails operational parameters such as sampling rate, resolu-\ntion, connectivity, and mobility, while considering practical\naspects of usability, interoperability, and translational poten-\ntial.\nBy integrating these dimensions, this review offers a\ndecision-support framework to guide scientists, engineers,\nand clinicians in selecting brain monitoring technologies that\nare best suited to their methodological and operational re-\nquirements. Ultimately, its goal is to strengthen the interface\nbetween biomedical engineering and clinical neuroscience,\naccelerating the translation of portable brain monitoring sys-\ntems into real-world neurorehabilitation contexts and advanc-\ning the development of evidence-based neurotechnological\npractice.\nII. BACKGROUND\nSeveral studies have directly addressed the scope of this work,\nproviding relevant findings and insights. According to [1],\nEEG remains a preferred modality in neuroscience and BCI\nresearch due to its widespread familiarity and high temporal\nresolution, which makes it particularly suitable for appli-\ncations such as mental state classification, motor imagery,\nbrain–computer interfaces, robotic control, and neuroadap-\ntive games.\nReference [2] conducted a standardized comparison of six\nEEG systems, isolating signal quality from classifier per-\nformance. The active gel-based system achieved the highest\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), followed by a passive gel system,\nwhile other passive and dry electrode systems exhibited re-\nduced performance because of design and contact limitations.\nThe Saline-based electrodes showed the lowest signal quality.\nDespite lower SNR, wireless and dry systems are often fa-\nvored in short-term or user-oriented contexts for their comfort\nand usability. For clinical or high-performance BCI applica-\ntions, high-end systems remain the most reliable, though mid-\nrange commercial devices may offer a cost-effective balance\nof signal quality and operational flexibility.\nA study summarizes general technical specifications for\nsix EEG devices and notes that several studies have em-\npirically evaluated the effectiveness of these wearable neu-\nrotechnologies in fundamental research and BCI applications\n[3]. Reference [4] presents a comprehensive review of driver\ndrowsiness detection systems, examining 24 EEG-based tech-\nnologies that use physiological brain signals to determine\ndrowsiness and wakefulness.\nAn overview of wireless EEG hardware is provided by\n[5]. This comprehensive survey includes 48 wireless EEG\ndevices, outlining key features and specifications to enable\nside-by-side comparisons and support informed hardware se-\nlection. Additionally, it reviews 110 publications that em-\nployed wireless EEG, categorizing them by application and\nanalyzing factors such as the devices used, number of chan-\nnels, sample sizes, and participant mobility. Complementing\nthis analysis, the paper provides background information and\ncritical commentary on the challenges and considerations\ninherent to wireless EEG research, offering valuable insights.\nAs noted by [6], BCIs enable brain–device communica-\ntion, typically via EEG. Common systems range from single-\nchannel dry electrodes for targeted monitoring to saline-based\ndevices offering broader functionality. Lightweight multi-\nchannel setups are preferred for comprehensive recordings,\nwhile headband-style devices are often used in gaming and\nsleep assessments. Dry electrodes are generally favored over\nwet ones due to reduced setup time and improved comfort.\nDevice selection depends on the application and critical pa-\nrameters such as sampling rate, resolution, battery life, and\nelectrode count.\nAccording to [7], wet EEG devices—research/clinical-\ngrade systems with 32 to 256 channels, costing tens of\nthousands of dollars—offer high signal stability and sup-\nport advanced analyses, making them suitable for lab-\n2\nVOLUME 11, 2023\nPage 5 of 202\n\nAuthor et al.: Preparation of Papers for IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS\nbased research. However, they require trained personnel,\n15–30 minutes for setup, and hair washing. These sys-\ntems are scalable and provide reliable raw data access,\nthough algorithm availability is limited. In contrast, dry\nsystems—consumer/research-grade, priced under a few thou-\nsand dollars—offer 1 to 64 channels, minimal setup time\n(up to 10 minutes), and do not require hair washing. They\nprovide moderate to high comfort and, despite variable signal\nstability, are wireless and support hyperscanning recordings,\nmaking them well-suited for real-world applications.\nConsumer-grade EEG systems generally perform well un-\nder high-SNR conditions, such as event-related potential\n(ERP) paradigms, but often underperform in real-world, low-\nSNR environments. Signal quality assessments indicate that\nresearch-grade systems and a greater number of sensors yield\nmore reliable data in mobile contexts. These findings suggest\nthat, for studies in naturalistic settings, consumer-grade de-\nvices may be insufficient, and further advancements in dry\nelectrode technology are needed to ensure adequate signal\nquality [8]. Reference [9] conducted a large-scale review of\nthe technical specifications of 16 wireless EEG systems from\nmultiple manufacturers. The study shows a comparative anal-\nysis of key features, underscoring the increasing accessibility\nand formal classification of wireless EEG technologies.\nAnother study [10] presents a table of 31 devices focused\non measuring brain activity related to the central nervous\nsystem, highlighting key market players and their most rep-\nresentative products. Reference [11] classifies 22 brain mon-\nitoring devices based on their primary applications: executive\nfunction, psychomotor skills, and behavioral, emotional, and\nsensory domains. Study selection and analysis were system-\natically conducted following the PRISMA-ScR framework.\nReference [12] reports the development of a low-cost EEG\nsystem and compares commercial devices ranging from USD\n300 to 50,000. High-end prices reflect regulatory certifica-\ntions required for clinical use, which are often unnecessary\nfor non-clinical BCIs. The limited availability of afford-\nable, high-quality options leads researchers to rely on costly\nclinical-grade systems. As costs scale with channel count,\nreducing electrode number and optimizing spatial placement\ncan improve cost-efficiency without compromising perfor-\nmance.\nPassive EEG electrodes transmit signals directly to the\namplifier, while active electrodes incorporate a preamplifier.\nReliable recordings require stable electrode–scalp contact,\nshielding against electromagnetic interference, and consistent\nsignal acquisition. Improved contact enhances noise identifi-\ncation and data reliability, potentially reducing the required\nsample size (n). Skin impedance decreases from ∼200 kΩ\n(uncleaned) to ∼120 kΩ(cleaned), with further reduction\nachievable through exfoliation or alcohol application at the\nelectrode site [13].\nWet EEG electrodes with gel provide low impedance\n(<10 kΩ) but require skin preparation, electrolyte applica-\ntion, and cleaning. Signal quality declines as the gel dries,\nlimiting its suitability for non-clinical use. Saline-based elec-\ntrodes offer an alternative but may irritate abraded skin and\npromote oxidation, reducing lifespan [13], [14]. Dry elec-\ntrodes enable faster setup; although impedance is higher, ad-\nvanced algorithms reduce noise and artifacts. Well-designed\ndry systems combining optimized materials, placement, and\nshielding can achieve signal quality comparable to wet sys-\ntems [14], [15], [16], [17]. Silver electrodes coated with silver\nchloride (Ag/AgCl) remain the gold standard due to their\ncorrosion resistance [18].\nFurthermore, low-cost EEG modules, typically compatible\nwith open-source development platforms, have emerged as\naccessible alternatives for initial investigations, educational\npurposes, and non-clinical research. However, their limited\nfunctionality and susceptibility to noise constrain their use in\nhigh-precision applications [19].\nThe common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of driven right\nleg (DRL) circuits is essential for minimizing common-mode\nnoise in biopotential recordings. DRL systems operate by\ninverting the common-mode voltage, detected via a common-\nmode sense (CMS) electrode, and feeding it back to the partic-\nipant through the DRL electrode. This negative feedback re-\nduces interference at the amplifier inputs, enhancing CMRR\nand signal fidelity. Combined, CMS and DRL improve noise\nrejection and overall recording reliability [20].\nThe lab streaming layer (LSL) enables precise multimodal\nsynchronization without hardware triggers, supporting seam-\nless integration with platforms such as MATLAB, Python,\nOpenViBE, BCI2000, and Unity. It synchronizes EEG, video,\nperipheral sensors, and stimulus markers for real-time appli-\ncations, enhancing interoperability and scalability in research\n[21].\nThe fNIRS measures cortical oxygenation and blood flow\nup to ∼15 mm depth using red and near-infrared light. Emit-\nted light penetrates the scalp and skull, interacts with brain\ntissue, and is detected by infrared sensors positioned a few\ncentimeters away. Absorption patterns, influenced by changes\nin hemoglobin saturation, allow inference of cortical activity.\nRed light is primarily absorbed by oxygenated hemoglobin,\nwhile near-infrared light reflects total blood concentration.\nShort source–detector separations minimize contamination\nfrom superficial tissues, enhancing signal specificity [22].\nLatency, response time, jitter, and throughput are key per-\nformance metrics in wireless EEG and fNIRS systems, influ-\nencing reliability and real-time operation. Latency is the delay\nfrom neural or hemodynamic activity to its digitized signal;\nresponse time adds processing delays. Jitter, or variability in\nthese times, reduces temporal precision, while throughput,\nthe rate of successful data transmission, often trades off with\nlatency. Optimizing these metrics is essential for temporal\nresolution, data integrity, and real-time responsiveness [23],\n[24], [25], [26].\nBrain monitoring devices increasingly integrate multi-\nmodal biosensors, including electrocardiography (ECG),\nphotoplethysmography (PPG), pulse oximetry, and blood\npressure for cardiovascular monitoring; electromyography\n(EMG) and electrooculography (EOG) for neuromuscular\nVOLUME 11, 2023\n3\nPage 6 of 202\n\nAuthor et al.: Preparation of Papers for IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS\nand ocular activity; and inertial measurement units (IMU),\nrespiration sensors, and ballistocardiography (BCG) for mo-\ntion and breathing. Galvanic skin response (GSR) and thermal\nsensors track skin conductance and temperature, while some\nsystems add eye tracking and light-based neuromodulation,\nsuch as transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) and near-\ninfrared photobiomodulation (NIR-PBM).\nIII. METHOD\nThis scoping review employed a structured documentary ap-\nproach to identify and characterize commercially available\nbrain-monitoring devices. Data were collected from both pri-\nmary scientific literature and secondary sources, including\npatents, user manuals, and manufacturer websites. Devices\nwere included based on the following criteria: (i) noninvasive\nneurotechnologies; (ii) portable form factor suitable for clin-\nical or field use; (iii) commercial availability in the global\nmarket; (iv) sold as complete bundled systems rather than\nmodular components; and (v) demonstrated or potential rele-\nvance to neuroscience and neurorehabilitation applications.\nTo define the technological scope of the review, MeSH\ncategories were consulted. “Diagnostic Techniques and Pro-\ncedures” was selected as the overarching classification\nencompassing brain-monitoring modalities across the tar-\nget databases. Identified technologies included EEG, HEG,\nNIRS, fNIRS, PET, MEG, MRI, and fMRI. However, the\nfinal analysis focused exclusively on noninvasive, portable,\nand wireless EEG and fNIRS devices.\nDatabase searches were conducted from March to August\n2025 across five platforms: IEEE Xplore, PubMed/MEDLINE,\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Embase. Each search employed\na Boolean query combining device name, manufacturer, and\ntechnology terms (e.g., “device” AND “manufacturer” AND\n“EEG/fNIRS”). Queries were adapted to the syntax and\nindexing structure of each database. IEEE Xplore was used\nfor engineering and hardware design; PubMed/MEDLINE for\nits coverage of biomedical literature; Web of Science and Sco-\npus for multidisciplinary indexing and citation tracking; and\nEmbase for its emphasis on medical devices and international\ncontent.\nThe number of DOI-indexed publications referencing each\nidentified device was recorded to assess research use. No lan-\nguage or date restrictions were applied. Pricing information,\nwhen available, was collected in U.S. dollars, with currency\nconversion applied as needed. In cases where prices were\nnot publicly disclosed, some manufacturers were contacted\ndirectly. However, the prices are not presented to respect\nconfidentiality and variation in purchasing terms.\nA summary table was compiled for all eligible devices, in-\ncluding technical parameters such as the number of channels,\nelectrode type, sampling rate, data connectivity, software\navailability, and intended application. Additionally, peer-\nreviewed articles reporting experimental or clinical use of\neach device were identified to verify relevance, deployment,\nand impact across neuroscience and biomedical engineering\ndomains.\nThe protocol of this scoping review was prospectively\nregistered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) under the\nregistration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/EMRH8.\nIV. RESULTS\nA total of 5,071 records were retrieved from the selected\nscientific databases based on the inclusion criteria. After\nremoving 1,331 duplicates (26.25%), 3,741 unique records\nremained. Of these, 2,087 studies explicitly reported the use\nof brain monitoring devices in clinical trials, dataset develop-\nment, or technological assessments, yielding a true positive\nrate of 55.79%. Eighty records (2.14%) were excluded due\nto a lack of access. Supplementary technical information was\nobtained from manufacturers’ websites and consolidated in\nTable 1, comprising 96 devices, 125 when including model\nvariants. Research adoption was quantified by the number\nof DOI-indexed publications referencing each device. No\ncritical appraisal of individual sources of evidence was per-\nformed, as this scoping review aimed to map the extent and\nnature of the literature without assessing study quality.\nA.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\nThe 125 devices identified in this work span an impressive\nrange of channel counts, from ultra-compact single-channel\nunits designed for basic biofeedback to full 150-channel\nresearch-grade rigs. Counts in the studies found column in-\ndicate not only device popularity but also empirical maturity,\nreflecting the availability of reliable estimates for signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR), noise spectral profiles, dropout rates, and\nVOLUME 11, 2023\n5\nPage 8 of 202\n\nAuthor et al.: Preparation of Papers for IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS\noperational parameters such as typical impedance, setup time,\nand gain/analog-to-digital converter (ADC) stability. Devices\nwith extensive literature typically exhibit well-characterized\nsensor geometries and analog front-ends, enabling informed\ntechnical decisions on montage, preprocessing (bandpass,\nnotch, referencing), artifact modeling (ICA templates, motion\nregression), and synchronization requirements for ERP or\nclosed-loop paradigms. However, a high publication count\ndoes not eliminate methodological risks: firmware or driver\nupdates, raw data access policies, and reliance on proprietary\npipelines may introduce systematic biases and affect inter-\nsite reproducibility. These factors require authors to report the\nfirmware version and exact acquisition conditions.\nSome models are frequently cited (often due to accessi-\nbility and cost), while others show few or no reported ap-\nplications, indicating a lack of independent validation. For\nstudies requiring statistical robustness and reproducibility\n(e.g., clinical ERP, connectivity analyses), selecting devices\nwith substantial prior use reduces measurement bias risk.\nIn exploratory or prototyping contexts, devices with limited\npublications may still be valuable if accompanied by tech-\nnical validation (pilot SNR, dropout, latency) and explicit\ndiscussion of generalization limits, as low study counts may\nreflect novelty or barriers such as cost, licensing, or raw data\navailability.\nSampling rates across these devices reflect their intended\napplications. Consumer-grade and low-power BCI headsets\noften operate at 86–250 Hz, sufficient for basic cognitive and\naffective studies. Most research-oriented systems, however,\nsample between 250 Hz and 1 kHz, supporting standard\nERP, spectral, and time–frequency analyses without aliasing.\nA few multimodal platforms push sampling rates up to 16\nkHz to capture high-frequency EEG or evoked potentials\nwith millisecond precision, though this comes with increased\ndemands for data storage and transmission.\nBit depth is another critical differentiator. Lower-cost units\ntypically employ 12–14-bit ADCs, adequate for classroom\ndemonstrations or basic neurofeedback. Mid-tier research\nsystems almost universally provide 16-bit resolution, offering\na robust SNR for most experimental paradigms. Premium\ndevices feature 24-bit or even 32-bit converters, minimizing\nquantization noise and maximizing dynamic range for de-\ntecting subtle oscillatory phenomena or conducting source\nlocalization.\nConnectivity options mirror trade-offs between mobility\nand data throughput. Bluetooth dominates the entry and mid-\nrange segments, enabling wireless operation at sampling rates\nup to 1 kHz with latencies suitable for BCI control or ambula-\ntory monitoring. A smaller subset of systems supports Wi-Fi\nstreaming, which is essential for multi-subject experiments\n(hyperscanning).\nSoftware support is a major consideration beyond hard-\nware specifications. Approximately 70–80% of devices in-\nclude their own acquisition and visualization suites; more\nadvanced systems supplement this with Python, MATLAB, or\nLabVIEW SDKs, enabling custom preprocessing, real-time\nartifact rejection, and precise synchronization with stimuli\nor other biosignals. Entry-level headsets may only permit\naudio-based triggers or manual markers, adequate for broad\ncognitive tasks but insufficient for high-precision studies or\nclosed-loop neuromodulation.\nBased on a renowned manufacturer whose devices are\nwidely recognized in research, the cost of EEG systems varies\nsignificantly with the number of channels, which directly\naffects spatial resolution and the range of clinical or research\napplications. Lower-channel systems, such as 8-channel de-\nvices, are priced around $6,000 (USD), making them suitable\nfor basic monitoring tasks, educational use, or preliminary\nresearch. As channel count increases, so does the system’s\ncomplexity and capabilities, resulting in higher costs. For\ninstance, a 16-channel EEG device is priced at approximately\n$14,000, while a 32-channel system costs about $24,000.\nHigh-density EEG systems with 64 channels offer superior\nspatial resolution and advanced signal acquisition but are sub-\nstantially more expensive, often exceeding $50,000. These\nprice differences highlight the trade-offs between cost, signal\nquality, and application scope, underscoring the importance\nof selecting a system that aligns with the project’s specific\nneeds and budgetary constraints.\nRegarding devices with electrode caps, the choice of base\nmaterial is critical. Densely woven meshes and thick fabrics,\nsuch as neoprene, may cause discomfort due to increased\nscalp pressure and heat retention, given the head’s sensitivity\nto temperature variations. Excessive or uneven pressure can\ndegrade signal quality by affecting the electrode–skin inter-\nface, increasing impedance, and introducing motion artifacts.\nFurthermore, sustained pressure may lead to thermal discom-\nfort and sweating, which can further impair conductivity.\nAsymmetrical pressure distribution may also introduce arti-\nficial asymmetries in the recorded data. Consequently, device\ndesign must prioritize ergonomic fit and material selection to\nensure user comfort while preserving signal integrity and data\nreliability.\nThe “Epoc X” device by Emotiv leads the number of\nresearch publications with 19.30%, followed by the Open-\nBCI system with 4.81%, and the “MindWave Mobile 2” by\nNeurosky with 4.06%. All three are consumer-grade models.\nIn fourth place appears the first research-grade device, the\nEnobio by Neuroelectrics, with 2.89%. The g.Nautilus by\ng.tec ranks eighth, representing 1.71% of usage in published\nresearch.\nThese findings demonstrate a global effort by researchers\nto conduct accessible studies using user-friendly, low-cost,\nand widely available devices, revealing a significant gap be-\ntween consumer-grade and research-grade technologies.\nIn summary, most rehabilitation-oriented neuroscience\nstudies will find an optimal balance in 16 to 32-channel\ndevices sampling at 1 kHz with 16-bit resolution, Bluetooth\nstreaming, and a user-friendly SDK. For laboratories with\ngreater demands for spatial resolution or multimodal record-\ning, premium systems—though more expensive and opera-\ntionally demanding—offer unparalleled data quality and flex-\n6\nVOLUME 11, 2023\nPage 9 of 202\n\nAuthor et al.: Preparation of Papers for IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS\nibility. By understanding how hardware and software parame-\nters interact, researchers can select a brain monitoring system\nthat best balances spatial coverage, signal fidelity, mobility,\nand cost to meet their specific investigative goals.\nC. LIMITATIONS OF TECHNOLOGIES EVALUATED\nThe technologies applied in brain research have been funda-\nmental in enhancing our understanding of the nervous system\nand in developing interventions for neurorehabilitation. How-\never, their use comes with several limitations that can impact\ntheir effectiveness, applicability, and reach across different\ncontexts. These limitations span technical, economic, and\noperational aspects, all of which must be carefully considered\nin the development and implementation of these tools.\nFrom a technical perspective, key challenges include res-\nolution, accuracy, and response time. EEG, for example, of-\nfers excellent temporal resolution but lower spatial resolution\ncompared to fNIRS. Response time is particularly critical\nfor real-time applications such as neurofeedback and BCI\ndevelopment. Reliability is another concern, as noise and\nexternal interference can compromise data quality and reduce\nthe effectiveness of the methods. EEG measures electrical\nactivity from the cerebral cortex, but signal distortions occur\nas electrical potentials pass through the skull and scalp. These\nsignals range from approximately -90 mV at rest to 40 mV at\nthe peak of an action potential and require amplification, an\nessential step that can also introduce additional noise.\nNoise sources include improper electrode placement, oxi-\ndized or deteriorated electrodes, weak scalp attachment, poor\ncontact due to dry or oily skin, hair strands, dirt, and crusts.\nAdditional sources include movement artifacts from muscle\nactivity, blinking, heartbeats, and electromagnetic interfer-\nence caused by electrical transients, radio frequencies, and\ngrounding issues. Given these challenges, EEG devices re-\nquire meticulous electronic design, careful assembly, and cir-\ncuits for attenuating oscillating electromagnetic frequencies.\nConnections and circuits must be shielded, cables should\nbe short and shielded, and electrodes must be firmly and\nconsistently attached to the scalp. Even with these precau-\ntions, significant computational effort is needed to filter the\nresulting signals effectively.\nDue to the complex, non-stationary, and nonlinear charac-\nteristics of EEG signals, several systems have been developed\nfor data analysis. Signal complexity can be reduced using fast\nalgorithms, enabling machine learning methods to automat-\nically classify certain mental disorders with high accuracy.\nDisorders such as depression and epilepsy could be diagnosed\nat the same time. However, EEG-based diagnosis has limita-\ntions: patients may not exhibit abnormal patterns consistently,\nand short EEG recordings can miss critical events, leading to\ninaccurate results. While long-term monitoring improves the\ndetection of abnormalities, EEG signals are highly suscepti-\nble to external interference, and detecting periods of inactivity\nremains challenging [27].\nUsability and ergonomics are key factors that influence the\nadoption of these technologies. Sensors and devices can be\nuncomfortable during extended acquisition sessions, while\ncomplex interfaces and advanced technical requirements may\nlimit their use in clinical or home environments. The portabil-\nity of certain devices, such as brain imaging systems (fMRI\nor PET), is also constrained by their size and dependence\non specialized infrastructure, restricting their application to\nresearch centers or hospitals. Additionally, the high cost of ad-\nvanced technologies constitutes a barrier to their widespread\nimplementation.\nThe fNIRS faces challenges in distinguishing brain hemo-\ndynamic changes from artifacts caused by scalp hemodynam-\nics or movement. Photons detected by infrared receivers are\ninfluenced by physiological factors like respiration and heart\nrate, reducing contrast and spatial resolution. The technique\nalso suffers from low temporal resolution and SNR [28].\nEfforts to improve signal quality range from averaging mul-\ntiple readings to using advanced statistical models, but low\nsensitivity to deeper brain layers and the inherent statistical\nproperties of the signal complicate data interpretation [29].\nSome technologies are unsuitable for patients with metal\nimplants or cognitive impairments. Combining these tools\nwith conventional therapeutic approaches can be complex,\nparticularly when determining the clinical relevance of the\ndata collected. Ethical and privacy concerns related to brain\nand physiological data collection further complicate their\nadoption, necessitating stringent regulations to ensure user\ntrust and safety.\nThe EEG technology has advanced with the development\nof wireless systems, dry electrodes, and AI-driven data pro-\ncessing. Dry electrodes enhance usability by enabling faster\nand more accessible setups. While fNIRS is less affected\nby electromagnetic interference, its sensitivity is limited by\nthe slower hemodynamic response compared to the rapid\ntransmission of electrical signals in EEG. AI-enhanced multi-\nmodal fNIRS systems are approaching clinical-grade perfor-\nmance, although high costs remain a significant barrier.\nThe term research-grade quality is often used to describe\ndevices suitable for scientific studies but not meeting the\nstringent standards required for clinical use. In contrast, low-\ncost EEG modules, priced under fifty dollars, offer affordable\nalternatives. Commonly sold as do-it-yourself (DIY) kits,\nthese modules allow for customized assembly, making EEG\ntechnology more accessible. While they lack the advanced\nfeatures and precision of clinical-grade systems, they still\nprovide meaningful insights into brain activity.\nSoftware is often sold separately, significantly increasing\noverall costs. Commercial solutions typically start around\n$1,000, with advanced versions reaching up to $8,000. Tem-\nporary licenses, renewable subscriptions, and lite versions\nwith limited functionality are common, while open-source\nplatforms offer more accessible alternatives. Some systems\nare specifically designed for neurofeedback, with software\ntailored to training games. Increasingly, brain monitoring\ndevices integrate artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time data\nprocessing, anomaly detection, and rapid diagnostics. Open\naccess to raw or AI-processed data fosters innovation and\nVOLUME 11, 2023\n7\nPage 10 of 202\n\nAuthor et al.: Preparation of Papers for IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS\nsupports new research applications. Free access to AI-filtered\ndata is a valuable resource for the neuroscience community.\nSeveral brain equipment manufacturers offer either com-\nplete systems or modular components, allowing for user\ncustomization, though often without clear guidance for se-\nlection. Some companies, traditionally focused on wired\nsystems, have introduced wireless options, typically lim-\nited to amplifiers without caps. Others operate exclusively\nthrough rental or contracted services, while certain technolo-\ngies remain under development. Identified manufacturers in-\nclude Compumedics Neuroscan (AUS), fNIR Devices (USA),\nHitachi (JPN), Neurosoft (RUS), BioSemi (NLD), iCel-\nera (BRA), Contec (CHN), Meditron (BRA), Neurovirtual\n(USA), TechEn (USA), Imec (BEL), Kernel (USA), Mind-\nfield (DEU), NeuroPro (CHE), Gowerlabs (ENG), Neurotec\n(BRA), and Deymed (CZE). Additionally, low-cost module\nproviders include Deuteron (ISR) and Sichiray (CHN). In\nsome cases, websites are outdated or provide little evidence of\nongoing product availability, raising concerns about whether\nsome manufacturers are still active.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis review provides a comprehensive and technically\ngrounded synthesis of the current landscape of noninvasive\nbrain monitoring technologies, with emphasis on their appli-\ncability to neuroscience and neurorehabilitation. By system-\natically mapping the specifications, architectures, and oper-\national features of commercially available EEG and fNIRS\nsystems, the study translates complex engineering data into an\nactionable framework for device selection and experimental\ndesign. The proposed framework supports researchers and\nclinicians in aligning technical parameters with the specific\ngoals of their investigations, facilitating evidence-based, re-\nproducible, and methodologically sound use of neurotechno-\nlogical tools.\nThe analysis highlights that device selection should be\nguided primarily by the intended research or clinical ob-\njective. High temporal resolution and signal fidelity are\nessential for applications such as event-related potentials\nand functional connectivity analysis, whereas mobility, ease\nof deployment, and rapid setup are critical for field stud-\nies, BCI applications, and rehabilitation in movement-rich\ncontexts. Multimodal configurations, such as integrated\nEEG–fNIRS systems, further expand the potential for real-\ntime monitoring, neurofeedback, and closed-loop virtual re-\nality paradigms. Across modalities, core decision parameters\ninclude electrode or optode type, channel density, sampling\nrate, bit resolution, wireless transmission protocol, and data\naccessibility through standardized interfaces or SDKs.\nPractical trade-offs also emerge among systems. Wet and\ngel-based electrodes provide the highest signal quality but\nrequire time-intensive preparation, while dry and semi-dry\nelectrodes enhance usability and participant comfort at the\ncost of slightly increased impedance. Channel configurations\nbetween 8 and 32 are suitable for most BCI and connectivity\nstudies, whereas high-density arrays (≥64 channels) enable\nsource localization and advanced spatial analysis. Sampling\nrates between 250 and 500 Hz meet the majority of experi-\nmental demands, while higher rates (≥1 kHz) and 24-bit reso-\nlution are recommended for precision time-locked paradigms.\nReliable wireless connectivity—preferably low-latency Wi-\nFi for data-intensive applications and Bluetooth Low Energy\nfor mobile protocols—supports robust multimodal synchro-\nnization and integration with immersive environments.\nIn applied neurorehabilitation, integration with virtual re-\nality systems requires ergonomically optimized, low-latency\ndevices capable of sustaining high-quality signal acquisition\nduring motion. Systems equipped with open SDKs and native\nsynchronization libraries facilitate seamless communication\nwith VR engines, enabling adaptive neurofeedback and eco-\nlogical data capture. Dry electrode designs are particularly ad-\nvantageous in these contexts, improving participant comfort\nand reducing setup time while maintaining acceptable signal\nstability for most training and assessment scenarios.\nThe findings from the strong body of evidence in the\nscientific literature highlight a global movement toward in-\ncreasing the accessibility of neuroscience research through\nuser-friendly, affordable, and widely available devices, while\nalso underscoring the persistent gap that remains between\nconsumer-grade and research-grade technologies.\nThe compiled dataset provides an evidence-based frame-\nwork to guide neuroscientists, engineers, and clinicians in se-\nlecting the most appropriate device for their specific research\nneeds. This work also identifies critical technological trends,\nsuch as the strong convergence toward wireless architectures\nand the growing emphasis on open data interfaces.\nOverall, this study contributes a reproducible, evidence-\nbased technical mapping of EEG and fNIRS technolo-\ngies, consolidating information from scientific, industrial,\nand patent sources into a unified classification framework.\nBeyond informing device acquisition, these findings pro-\nmote greater interoperability, transparency, and standardiza-\ntion within the neurotechnology ecosystem. Future research\nshould expand the evaluation scope to include longitudinal\ndata quality, real-world reliability, and user experience met-\nrics, strengthening the translational bridge between engineer-\ning innovation and clinical neurorehabilitation. By doing so,\nthe field moves closer to developing adaptive, accessible, and\nscientifically validated neurotechnological platforms capable\nof transforming both neuroscience research and patient care.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge the support of CNPq and CAPES,\nwhose continued commitment to scientific research, educa-\ntion, and innovation in Brazil made this work possible.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y.
