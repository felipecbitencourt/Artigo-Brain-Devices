The technologies applied in brain research have been fundamental in enhancing our understanding of 
the nervous system and in developing interventions for neurorehabilitation. However, their use 
comes with several limitations that can impact their effectiveness, applicability, and reach across 
different contexts. These limitations span technical, economic, and operational aspects, all of which 
must be carefully considered in the development and implementation of these tools. 
 
From a technical perspective, key challenges include resolution, accuracy, and response time. EEG, for 
example, offers excellent temporal resolution but lower spatial resolution compared to fNIRS. 
Response time is particularly critical for real-time applications such as neurofeedback and BCI 
development. Reliability is another concern, as noise and external interference can compromise data 
quality and reduce the effectiveness of the methods. EEG measures electrical activity from the 
cerebral cortex, but signal distortions occur as electrical potentials pass through the skull and scalp. 
These signals range from approximately -90 mV at rest to 40 mV at the peak of an action potential 
and require amplification, an essential step that can also introduce additional noise. 
 
Noise sources include improper electrode placement, oxidized or deteriorated electrodes, weak scalp 
attachment, poor contact due to dry or oily skin, hair strands, dirt, and crusts. Additional sources 
include movement artifacts from muscle activity, blinking, heartbeats, and electromagnetic 
interference caused by electrical transients, radio frequencies, and grounding issues. Given these 
challenges, EEG devices require meticulous electronic design, careful assembly, and circuits for 
attenuating oscillating electromagnetic frequencies. Connections and circuits must be shielded, 
cables should be short and shielded, and electrodes must be firmly and consistently attached to the 
scalp. Even with these precautions, significant computational effort is needed to filter the resulting 
signals effectively.

Due to the complex, non-stationary, and nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals, several systems 
have been developed for data analysis. Signal complexity can be reduced using fast algorithms, 
enabling machine learning methods to automatically classify certain mental disorders with high 
accuracy. Disorders such as depression and epilepsy could be diagnosed at the same time. However, 
EEG-based diagnosis has limitations: patients may not exhibit abnormal patterns consistently, and 
short EEG recordings can miss critical events, leading to inaccurate results. While long-term 
monitoring improves the detection of abnormalities, EEG signals are highly susceptible to external 
interference, and detecting periods of inactivity remains challenging [27]. 
 
Usability and ergonomics are key factors that influence the adoption of these technologies. Sensors 
and devices can be uncomfortable during extended acquisition sessions, while complex interfaces 
and advanced technical requirements may limit their use in clinical or home environments. The 
portability of certain devices, such as brain imaging systems (fMRI or PET), is also constrained by 
their size and dependence on specialized infrastructure, restricting their application to research 
centers or hospitals. Additionally, the high cost of advanced technologies constitutes a barrier to 
their widespread implementation. 
 
The fNIRS faces challenges in distinguishing brain hemodynamic changes from artifacts caused by 
scalp hemodynamics or movement. Photons detected by infrared receivers are influenced by 
physiological factors like respiration and heart rate, reducing contrast and spatial resolution. The 
technique also suffers from low temporal resolution and SNR [28]. Efforts to improve signal quality 
range from averaging multiple readings to using advanced statistical models, but low sensitivity to 
deeper brain layers and the inherent statistical properties of the signal complicate data 
interpretation [29]. 
 
Some technologies are unsuitable for patients with metal implants or cognitive impairments. 
Combining these tools with conventional therapeutic approaches can be complex, particularly when 
determining the clinical relevance of the data collected. Ethical and privacy concerns related to brain 
and physiological data collection further complicate their adoption, necessitating stringent 
regulations to ensure user trust and safety. 
 
The EEG technology has advanced with the development of wireless systems, dry electrodes, and 
AI-driven data processing. Dry electrodes enhance usability by enabling faster and more accessible 
setups. While fNIRS is less affected by electromagnetic interference, its sensitivity is limited by the 
slower hemodynamic response compared to the rapid transmission of electrical signals in EEG. 
AI-enhanced multimodal fNIRS systems are approaching clinical-grade performance, although high 
costs remain a significant barrier. 
 
The term research-grade quality is often used to describe devices suitable for scientific studies but 
not meeting the stringent standards required for clinical use. In contrast, low-cost EEG modules, 
priced under fifty dollars, offer affordable alternatives. Commonly sold as do-it-yourself (DIY) kits, 
these modules allow for customized assembly, making EEG technology more accessible. While they 
lack the advanced features and precision of clinical-grade systems, they still provide meaningful 
insights into brain activity. 
 
Software is often sold separately, significantly increasing overall costs. Commercial solutions typically 
start around \$1,000, with advanced versions reaching up to \$8,000. Temporary licenses, renewable 
subscriptions, and lite versions with limited functionality are common, while open-source platforms

offer more accessible alternatives. Some systems are specifically designed for neurofeedback, with 
software tailored to training games. Increasingly, brain monitoring devices integrate artificial 
intelligence (AI) for real-time data processing, anomaly detection, and rapid diagnostics. Open access 
to raw or AI-processed data fosters innovation and supports new research applications. Free access 
to AI-filtered data is a valuable resource for the neuroscience community. 
 
Several brain equipment manufacturers offer either complete systems or modular components, 
allowing for user customization, though often without clear guidance for selection. Some companies, 
traditionally focused on wired systems, have introduced wireless options, typically limited to 
amplifiers without caps. Others operate exclusively through rental or contracted services, while 
certain technologies remain under development. Identified manufacturers include Compumedics 
Neuroscan (AUS), fNIR Devices (USA), Hitachi (JPN), Neurosoft (RUS), BioSemi (NLD), iCelera (BRA), 
Contec (CHN), Meditron (BRA), Neurovirtual (USA), TechEn (USA), Imec (BEL), Kernel (USA), 
Mindfield (DEU), NeuroPro (CHE), Gowerlabs (ENG), Neurotec (BRA), and Deymed (CZE). 
Additionally, low-cost module providers include Deuteron (ISR) and Sichiray (CHN). In some cases, 
websites are outdated or provide little evidence of ongoing product availability, raising concerns 
about whether some manufacturers are still active.
