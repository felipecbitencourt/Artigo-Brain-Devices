This review provides a comprehensive and technically grounded synthesis of the current landscape of 
noninvasive brain monitoring technologies, with emphasis on their applicability to neuroscience and 
neurorehabilitation. By systematically mapping the specifications, architectures, and operational 
features of commercially available EEG and fNIRS systems, the study translates complex engineering 
data into an actionable framework for device selection and experimental design. The proposed 
framework supports researchers and clinicians in aligning technical parameters with the specific 
goals of their investigations, facilitating evidence-based, reproducible, and methodologically sound 
use of neurotechnological tools. 
 
The analysis highlights that device selection should be guided primarily by the intended research or 
clinical objective. High temporal resolution and signal fidelity are essential for applications such as 
event-related potentials and functional connectivity analysis, whereas mobility, ease of deployment, 
and rapid setup are critical for field studies, BCI applications, and rehabilitation in movement-rich 
contexts. Multimodal configurations, such as integrated EEG–fNIRS systems, further expand the 
potential for real-time monitoring, neurofeedback, and closed-loop virtual reality paradigms. Across 
modalities, core decision parameters include electrode or optode type, channel density, sampling 
rate, bit resolution, wireless transmission protocol, and data accessibility through standardized 
interfaces or SDKs. 
 
Practical trade-offs also emerge among systems. Wet and gel-based electrodes provide the highest 
signal quality but require time-intensive preparation, while dry and semi-dry electrodes enhance 
usability and participant comfort at the cost of slightly increased impedance. Channel configurations 
between 8 and 32 are suitable for most BCI and connectivity studies, whereas high-density arrays 
($\ge$ 64 channels) enable source localization and advanced spatial analysis. Sampling rates between 
250 and 500 Hz meet the majority of experimental demands, while higher rates (\SI{\ge 
1}{\kilo\hertz}) and 24-bit resolution are recommended for precision time-locked paradigms. Reliable 
wireless connectivity—preferably low-latency Wi-Fi for data-intensive applications and Bluetooth 
Low Energy for mobile protocols—supports robust multimodal synchronization and integration with 
immersive environments.

In applied neurorehabilitation, integration with virtual reality systems requires ergonomically 
optimized, low-latency devices capable of sustaining high-quality signal acquisition during motion. 
Systems equipped with open SDKs and native synchronization libraries facilitate seamless 
communication with VR engines, enabling adaptive neurofeedback and ecological data capture. Dry 
electrode designs are particularly advantageous in these contexts, improving participant comfort and 
reducing setup time while maintaining acceptable signal stability for most training and assessment 
scenarios. 
 
The findings from the strong body of evidence in the scientific literature highlight a global movement 
toward increasing the accessibility of neuroscience research through user-friendly, affordable, and 
widely available devices, while also underscoring the persistent gap that remains between 
consumer-grade and research-grade technologies. 
 
The compiled dataset provides an evidence-based framework to guide neuroscientists, engineers, 
and clinicians in selecting the most appropriate device for their specific research needs. This work 
also identifies critical technological trends, such as the strong convergence toward wireless 
architectures and the growing emphasis on open data interfaces. 
 
Overall, this study contributes a reproducible, evidence-based technical mapping of EEG and fNIRS 
technologies, consolidating information from scientific, industrial, and patent sources into a unified 
classification framework. Beyond informing device acquisition, these findings promote greater 
interoperability, transparency, and standardization within the neurotechnology ecosystem. Future 
research should expand the evaluation scope to include longitudinal data quality, real-world 
reliability, and user experience metrics, strengthening the translational bridge between engineering 
innovation and clinical neurorehabilitation. By doing so, the field moves closer to developing 
adaptive, accessible, and scientifically validated neurotechnological platforms capable of 
transforming both neuroscience research and patient care.
