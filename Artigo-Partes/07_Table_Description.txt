Table 1 summarizes the technical, functional, and bibliometric characteristics of the EEG devices 
identified in this scoping review. The table reports the monitoring technology and commercial model, 
together with the device type, usage grade, manufacturer, and country of origin. The grade column 
classifies devices as consumer-grade, research-grade, or clinical-grade according to their intended 
use, technical capabilities, and regulatory context, providing a high-level distinction between 
wellness-oriented, research-focused, and clinically certified systems. 
 
Sensor-related information includes electrode type and sensor technology, reflecting conductive 
media requirements, signal acquisition principles, and factors affecting signal quality, noise 
susceptibility, and user comfort. Hardware configuration is described by the number of recording 
channels and electrode positioning, while wireless connectivity specifies the communication 
technology used for data transmission. 
 
Parameters relevant to data acquisition include the nominal sampling rate and analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC) resolution. Raw data access indicates whether unprocessed EEG signals are 
available to the user. Closed-loop readiness provides a proxy-based classification of device suitability 
for real-time and closed-loop applications, categorized as Low, Medium, or High, and inferred from 
transmission-related specifications, including wireless communication protocol, channel count, and 
nominal sampling rate. This classification supports a comparative assessment of real-time 
transmission constraints and performance trade-offs, without implying regulatory certification, 
experimentally validated latency or jitter, or guaranteed real-time performance. These proxy 
parameters reflect timing and bandwidth constraints relevant to closed-loop applications, such as 
real-time neurofeedback, adaptive BCI control, and event-locked multimodal synchronization. 
 
Software-related aspects are reported through bundled software and data synchronization. Bundled 
software describes the availability and licensing model of manufacturer-provided software for data 
acquisition, control, or visualization, including desktop, mobile, web-based, or cloud applications, 
whether included, freely available, open-source, subscription-based, or sold separately. Data 
synchronization indicates the availability of software interfaces and communication protocols, such 
as SDKs, APIs, LSL, or TCP, that enable event-based and temporal alignment of EEG data streams with 
external systems or multimodal sources. Auxiliary capabilities summarize additional integrated 
functionalities, such as inertial sensors or embedded analytics. 
 
Finally, price information, when available, is reported in U.S. dollars, excluding taxes and shipping, 
with currency conversion applied as needed; in cases where prices were not publicly disclosed, 
manufacturers were contacted, although such values are not shown to account for confidentiality 
and variability in purchasing terms. The bibliometric columns report the number of peer-reviewed 
studies using each device and the corresponding inclusion proportion, representing the share of 
included records in which the device was explicitly applied. 
 
Device design varies substantially across categories. Caps streamline setup, enhance sensor contact, 
and optimize signal quality. Headsets, resembling headphones, combine ease of use with safety, 
making them suitable for immersive clinical and non-clinical scenarios. Headbands provide

lightweight, ergonomic form factors ideal for cognitive research, neurofeedback, and brain-computer 
interfaces (BCI) in naturalistic environments. Earphones and headphones integrate auditory 
stimulation with EEG acquisition, while adhesive systems enable low-impedance, long-duration 
recordings, useful in intensive care unit (ICU) and sleep studies. The fNIRS caps and headsets offer 
spatial mapping of cortical activity and are used in complex cognitive and motor studies. Multimodal 
devices, including those integrating EEG with fNIRS, enhance spatial and temporal resolution, 
supporting applications such as virtual reality (VR)-based neurorehabilitation.
