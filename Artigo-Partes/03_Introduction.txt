Advances in neurotechnology have profoundly transformed the field of neurorehabilitation, enabling 
targeted stimulation of neuroplasticity, data-driven clinical decision-making, and continuous 
monitoring of brain activity in both laboratory and real-world settings. These systems integrate 
sensor-based monitoring, signal processing, and computational modeling to generate objective 
indicators of brain function, enhancing the precision, reproducibility, and personalization of 
therapeutic interventions. The emergence of portable, wireless, and cost-effective brain monitoring 
devices has further democratized access to neuroscience tools, allowing the acquisition of 
high-quality neural data under ecologically valid and movement-rich conditions that better reflect 
functional behavior in daily life. 
 
Among noninvasive neuroimaging modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have become fundamental in both clinical and experimental 
neuroscience. EEG records electrical potentials with high temporal resolution, providing direct 
insight into neuronal dynamics and oscillatory activity. Its portability, affordability, and compatibility 
with wearable architectures make it particularly suitable for neurofeedback and brain–computer 
interface (BCI) applications. In contrast, fNIRS measures hemodynamic changes associated with

cortical activation by detecting oxygenation-dependent absorption of near-infrared light. Although it 
provides lower temporal resolution than EEG, fNIRS achieves higher spatial location and greater 
robustness against electrical interference. When combined, EEG and fNIRS offer complementary 
information—temporal precision and hemodynamic specificity—creating multimodal platforms 
capable of characterizing the neural mechanisms underlying movement, learning, and recovery. 
 
In neurorehabilitation, these multimodal monitoring systems enable quantification of functional 
recovery and optimization of individualized therapy programs. They support closed-loop 
neurofeedback by providing brain-derived real-time metrics that guide adaptive training and 
promote cortical reorganization after neurological injury. When embedded in immersive or gamified 
environments, such systems enhance engagement and motivation, bridging neuroscience and 
rehabilitation engineering. The resulting datasets not only inform clinical decisions but also 
contribute to large-scale neurophysiological research through standardized and reproducible 
acquisition protocols. 
 
Despite their growing potential, selecting the most appropriate brain monitoring device remains a 
major challenge. The commercial landscape has expanded rapidly, encompassing numerous 
manufacturers and models with heterogeneous technical specifications, including differences in 
signal quality, channel count, electrode or optode design, wireless architecture, data accessibility, and 
integration capabilities. This diversity, coupled with the absence of standardized technical reporting, 
hinders direct comparison between systems and complicates the alignment of device performance 
with specific experimental or therapeutic goals. As a result, decision-making often becomes complex 
and time-consuming, resembling the paradox of choice, where an excess of alternatives may obscure 
optimal selection. 
 
To address this gap, the present work goes beyond existing wireless EEG and multimodal 
neurotechnology surveys by providing a large-scale, device-level mapping and technical 
characterization of commercially available EEG and fNIRS systems relevant to neuroscience and 
neurorehabilitation research. Unlike prior reviews that focus primarily on signal processing methods, 
experimental paradigms, or small subsets of devices, this study systematically analyzes 96 
commercially available systems using manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, patents, and 
secondary literature. The resulting framework integrates engineering specifications with 
application-oriented criteria, including connectivity, data access, synchronization support, and 
proxy-based closed-loop readiness, as well as bibliometric indicators of device adoption in the 
literature. By combining technical, applicational, and adoption-level perspectives, this review offers a 
translationally oriented resource that is not available in existing surveys. 
 
By integrating these dimensions, this review offers a decision-support framework to guide scientists, 
engineers, and clinicians in selecting brain monitoring technologies that are best suited to their 
methodological and operational requirements. Ultimately, its goal is to strengthen the interface 
between biomedical engineering and clinical neuroscience, accelerating the translation of portable 
brain monitoring systems into real-world neurorehabilitation contexts and advancing the 
development of evidence-based neurotechnological practice.
