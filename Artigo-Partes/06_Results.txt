A total of 5,071 records were retrieved from the selected scientific databases based on the inclusion 
criteria. After removing 1,331 duplicates (26.25\%), 3,741 unique records remained. Of these, 2,087 
studies explicitly reported the use of brain monitoring devices in clinical trials, dataset development, 
or technological assessments, yielding an inclusion rate of 55.79\% after title, abstract, and full-text 
screening. Eighty records (2.14\%) were excluded due to a lack of access. Supplementary technical 
information was obtained from manufacturers’ websites and consolidated in Table 1, comprising 96 
devices, 125 when including model variants. Research adoption was quantified by the number of 
DOI-indexed publications referencing each device. No critical appraisal of individual sources of 
evidence was performed, as this scoping review aimed to map the extent and nature of the literature 
without assessing study quality.

Footnote. Closed-loop readiness represents a proxy-based classification of device suitability for 
real-time and closed-loop applications. This indicator is inferred from transmission-related

specifications, including wireless communication protocol, channel count, nominal sampling rate, and 
data access capabilities. It does not reflect experimentally measured latency or jitter, nor does it 
imply regulatory certification or guaranteed real-time performance.
