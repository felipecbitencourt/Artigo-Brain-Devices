This review focuses on device-level technical specifications, reported capabilities, and usage patterns 
across the literature, rather than on experimental validation of signal quality or performance 
benchmarking under controlled conditions. As validation protocols, signal-to-noise ratios, and 
comparative performance metrics are highly task-, setup-, and population-dependent and are 
inconsistently reported across studies, a quantitative cross-device evaluation of signal quality was 
considered outside the scope of this scoping review. Instead, performance trade-offs between 
devices were examined at an architectural and applicational level, considering factors such as channel 
count, electrode technology, wireless communication protocol, data access, and software integration. 
 
The 125 devices identified in this work span an impressive range of channel counts, from 
ultra-compact single-channel units designed for basic biofeedback to full 150-channel 
research-grade rigs. Counts in the studies found column indicate not only device popularity but also 
empirical maturity, reflecting the availability of reliable estimates for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
noise spectral profiles, dropout rates, and operational parameters such as typical impedance, setup 
time, and gain/analog-to-digital converter (ADC) stability. Devices with extensive literature typically 
exhibit well-characterized sensor geometries and analog front-ends, enabling informed technical 
decisions on montage, preprocessing (bandpass, notch, referencing), artifact modeling (ICA 
templates, motion regression), and synchronization requirements for ERP or closed-loop paradigms. 
However, a high publication count does not eliminate methodological risks: firmware or driver 
updates, raw data access policies, and reliance on proprietary pipelines may introduce systematic 
biases and affect inter-site reproducibility. These factors require authors to report the firmware 
version and exact acquisition conditions.  
 
Some models are frequently cited (often due to accessibility and cost), while others show few or no 
reported applications, indicating a lack of independent validation. For studies requiring statistical 
robustness and reproducibility (e.g., clinical ERP, connectivity analyses), selecting devices with 
substantial prior use reduces measurement bias risk. In exploratory or prototyping contexts, devices 
with limited publications may still be valuable if accompanied by technical validation (pilot SNR, 
dropout, latency) and explicit discussion of generalization limits, as low study counts may reflect 
novelty or barriers such as cost, licensing, or raw data availability.  
 
Sampling rates across these devices reflect their intended applications. Consumer-grade and 
low-power BCI headsets often operate at 86–250 Hz, sufficient for basic cognitive and affective 
studies. Most research-oriented systems, however, sample between 250 Hz and 1 kHz, supporting 
standard ERP, spectral, and time–frequency analyses without aliasing. A few multimodal platforms 
push sampling rates up to 16 kHz to capture high-frequency EEG or evoked potentials with 
millisecond precision, though this comes with increased demands for data storage and transmission.

Bit depth is another critical differentiator. Lower-cost units typically employ 12–14-bit ADCs, 
adequate for classroom demonstrations or basic neurofeedback. Mid-tier research systems almost 
universally provide 16-bit resolution, offering a robust SNR for most experimental paradigms. 
Premium devices feature 24-bit or even 32-bit converters, minimizing quantization noise and 
maximizing dynamic range for detecting subtle oscillatory phenomena or conducting source 
localization.  
 
Connectivity options mirror trade-offs between mobility and data throughput. Bluetooth dominates 
the entry and mid-range segments, enabling wireless operation at sampling rates up to 1 kHz with 
latencies suitable for BCI control or ambulatory monitoring. A smaller subset of systems supports 
Wi-Fi streaming, which is essential for multi-subject experiments (hyperscanning). 
 
This scoping review focuses on device-level technical specifications and adoption patterns reported 
in the literature, rather than on clinical validation or experimental benchmarking of signal quality. 
 
Latency, jitter, and throughput were not reported as device-specific numerical values, as these 
metrics are rarely disclosed by manufacturers and are highly configuration-dependent. In this review, 
these parameters are therefore treated as application-level performance criteria, rather than 
experimental measurements, and were integrated into the comparative framework using protocol- 
and data-rate–based proxies. Throughput requirements were inferred from channel count and 
nominal sampling rate, while latency and jitter were contextualized according to the wireless 
communication protocol. In this context, quantitative integration refers to the use of minimum 
data-rate requirements and protocol-level constraints as comparative proxies, rather than to 
experimentally measured latency or jitter values. 
 
Software support is a major consideration beyond hardware specifications. Approximately 70–80\% 
of devices include their own acquisition and visualization suites; more advanced systems supplement 
this with Python, MATLAB, or LabVIEW SDKs, enabling custom preprocessing, real-time artifact 
rejection, and precise synchronization with stimuli or other biosignals. Entry-level headsets may only 
permit audio-based triggers or manual markers, adequate for broad cognitive tasks but insufficient 
for high-precision studies or closed-loop neuromodulation. 
 
Based on a renowned manufacturer whose devices are widely recognized in research, the cost of EEG 
systems varies significantly with the number of channels, which directly affects spatial resolution and 
the range of clinical or research applications. Lower-channel systems, such as 8-channel devices, are 
priced around \$6,000 (USD), making them suitable for basic monitoring tasks, educational use, or 
preliminary research. As channel count increases, so does the system’s complexity and capabilities, 
resulting in higher costs. For instance, a 16-channel EEG device is priced at approximately \$14,000, 
while a 32-channel system costs about \$24,000. High-density EEG systems with 64 channels offer 
superior spatial resolution and advanced signal acquisition but are substantially more expensive, 
often exceeding \$50,000. These price differences highlight the trade-offs between cost, signal 
quality, and application scope, underscoring the importance of selecting a system that aligns with the 
project's specific needs and budgetary constraints. 
 
Regarding devices with electrode caps, the choice of base material is critical. Densely woven meshes 
and thick fabrics, such as neoprene, may cause discomfort due to increased scalp pressure and heat 
retention, given the head’s sensitivity to temperature variations. Excessive or uneven pressure can 
degrade signal quality by affecting the electrode–skin interface, increasing impedance, and 
introducing motion artifacts. Furthermore, sustained pressure may lead to thermal discomfort and

sweating, which can further impair conductivity. Asymmetrical pressure distribution may also 
introduce artificial asymmetries in the recorded data. Consequently, device design must prioritize 
ergonomic fit and material selection to ensure user comfort while preserving signal integrity and data 
reliability. 
 
The “Epoc X” device by Emotiv leads the number of research publications with 19.30\%, followed by 
the OpenBCI system with 4.81\%, and the “MindWave Mobile 2” by Neurosky with 4.06\%. All three 
are consumer-grade models. In fourth place appears the first research-grade device, the Enobio by 
Neuroelectrics, with 2.89\%. The g.Nautilus by g.tec ranks eighth, representing 1.71\% of usage in 
published research. 
 
These findings demonstrate a global effort by researchers to conduct accessible studies using 
user-friendly, low-cost, and widely available devices, revealing a significant gap between 
consumer-grade and research-grade technologies. 
 
In summary, most rehabilitation-oriented neuroscience studies will find an optimal balance in 16 to 
32-channel devices sampling at 1 kHz with 16-bit resolution, Bluetooth streaming, and a 
user-friendly SDK. For laboratories with greater demands for spatial resolution or multimodal 
recording, premium systems—though more expensive and operationally demanding—offer 
unparalleled data quality and flexibility. By understanding how hardware and software parameters 
interact, researchers can select a brain monitoring system that best balances spatial coverage, signal 
fidelity, mobility, and cost to meet their specific investigative goals.
