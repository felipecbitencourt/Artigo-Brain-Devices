This scoping review employed a structured documentary approach to identify and characterize 
commercially available brain-monitoring devices. Data were collected from both primary scientific 
literature and secondary sources, including patents, user manuals, and manufacturer websites. 
Devices were included based on the following criteria: (i) noninvasive neurotechnologies; (ii) portable 
form factor suitable for clinical or field use; (iii) commercial availability in the global market; (iv) sold 
as complete bundled systems rather than modular components; and (v) demonstrated or potential 
relevance to neuroscience and neurorehabilitation applications.  
 
To define the technological scope of the review, MeSH categories were consulted. “Diagnostic 
Techniques and Procedures” was selected as the overarching classification encompassing 
brain-monitoring modalities across the target databases. Identified technologies included EEG, HEG, 
NIRS, fNIRS, PET, MEG, MRI, and fMRI. However, the final analysis focused exclusively on 
noninvasive, portable, and wireless EEG and fNIRS devices.  
 
Database searches were conducted from March to August 2025 across five platforms: IEEE Xplore, 
PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase. Each search employed a Boolean query 
combining device name, manufacturer, and technology terms (e.g., “device” AND “manufacturer” 
AND “EEG/fNIRS”). Queries were adapted to the syntax and indexing structure of each database. 
IEEE Xplore was used for engineering and hardware design; PubMed/MEDLINE for its coverage of 
biomedical literature; Web of Science and Scopus for multidisciplinary indexing and citation tracking; 
and Embase for its emphasis on medical devices and international content.  
 
An inclusion rate was used as a measure of search efficiency for each device-specific query. All 
retrieved records were screened to determine whether the named brain device was effectively 
applied as an experimental or clinical tool in the study; records in which the device name referred to 
an unrelated entity (e.g., personal names or acronyms with different meanings) or in which the device 
was merely mentioned without actual use were excluded. The inclusion rate was defined as the 
proportion of retrieved records that met the inclusion criterion of explicit device application, 
calculated as: 
Inclusion rate = 
Number of included studies using the device 
Total number of records retrieved for that device 
 
This metric reflects the precision of the device-specific search strategy, rather than sensitivity or 
recall, and was used to quantify the effectiveness of each query in identifying studies with confirmed 
device usage. 
 
The number of DOI-indexed publications referencing each identified device was recorded to assess 
research use. No language or date restrictions were applied. 
 
A summary table was compiled for all eligible devices, including technical parameters such as the 
number of channels, electrode type, sampling rate, data connectivity, software availability, and 
intended application. Additionally, peer-reviewed articles reporting experimental or clinical use of 
each device were identified to verify relevance, deployment, and impact across neuroscience and 
biomedical engineering domains.  
 
The protocol of this scoping review was prospectively registered in the Open Science Framework 
(OSF) under the registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/EMRH8.
