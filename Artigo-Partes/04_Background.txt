Several studies have directly addressed the scope of this work, providing relevant findings and 
insights. According to [1], EEG remains a preferred modality in neuroscience and BCI research due to 
its widespread familiarity and high temporal resolution, which makes it particularly suitable for

applications such as mental state classification, motor imagery, brain–computer interfaces, robotic 
control, and neuroadaptive games.  
 
Reference [2] conducted a standardized comparison of six EEG systems, isolating signal quality from 
classifier performance. The active gel-based system achieved the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
followed by a passive gel system, while other passive and dry electrode systems exhibited reduced 
performance because of design and contact limitations. The Saline-based electrodes showed the 
lowest signal quality. Despite lower SNR, wireless and dry systems are often favored in short-term or 
user-oriented contexts for their comfort and usability. For clinical or high-performance BCI 
applications, high-end systems remain the most reliable, though mid-range commercial devices may 
offer a cost-effective balance of signal quality and operational flexibility.  
 
A study summarizes general technical specifications for six EEG devices and notes that several 
studies have empirically evaluated the effectiveness of these wearable neurotechnologies in 
fundamental research and BCI applications [3]. Reference [4] presents a comprehensive review of 
driver drowsiness detection systems, examining 24 EEG-based technologies that use physiological 
brain signals to determine drowsiness and wakefulness.   
 
An overview of wireless EEG hardware is provided by [5]. This comprehensive survey includes 48 
wireless EEG devices, outlining key features and specifications to enable side-by-side comparisons 
and support informed hardware selection. Additionally, it reviews 110 publications that employed 
wireless EEG, categorizing them by application and analyzing factors such as the devices used, 
number of channels, sample sizes, and participant mobility. Complementing this analysis, the paper 
provides background information and critical commentary on the challenges and considerations 
inherent to wireless EEG research, offering valuable insights.  
 
As noted by [6], BCIs enable brain–device communication, typically via EEG. Common systems range 
from single-channel dry electrodes for targeted monitoring to saline-based devices offering broader 
functionality. Lightweight multichannel setups are preferred for comprehensive recordings, while 
headband-style devices are often used in gaming and sleep assessments. Dry electrodes are generally 
favored over wet ones due to reduced setup time and improved comfort. Device selection depends on 
the application and critical parameters such as sampling rate, resolution, battery life, and electrode 
count.  
 
EEG devices are commonly categorized based on a combination of intended use, technical 
specifications, signal quality, and regulatory status, rather than a single criterion such as price or 
channel count. Consumer-grade EEG systems are generally low-cost, portable, and easy to deploy, 
and are primarily marketed for non-clinical applications such as neurofeedback, gaming, wellness, 
and exploratory experimentation. These systems typically feature a limited number of channels, 
prioritize usability and comfort, and often employ dry or semi-dry electrodes, which may constrain 
signal robustness. Research-grade EEG systems are designed for academic and laboratory use and 
provide higher channel counts, improved signal-to-noise ratio, flexible acquisition parameters, and 
full access to raw data, supporting rigorous experimental protocols. Clinical-grade (or medical-grade) 
EEG systems are certified for diagnostic and clinical applications and must comply with stringent 
regulatory standards for safety, reliability, and performance, including formal medical device 
approval. Overall, this classification reflects increasing levels of data quality, experimental control, 
and regulatory compliance across consumer, research, and clinical contexts [Chuang and Lin, 2019], 
[Doudou et al., 2020].

According to [7], wet-electrode EEG systems classified as research-grade or clinical-grade typically 
comprise 32 to 256 channels, cost tens of thousands of dollars, and offer high signal stability suitable 
for advanced analyses in controlled laboratory or clinical environments. However, these systems 
require trained personnel, setup times of approximately 15–30 minutes, and post-recording hair 
washing, which limits their usability outside laboratory settings. Despite these constraints, they 
provide scalable architectures and reliable access to raw signals, although the availability of 
embedded algorithms is often limited. In contrast, dry-electrode EEG systems, commonly associated 
with consumer-grade and some research-grade devices, are generally priced under a few thousand 
dollars, support 1 to 64 channels, and allow rapid setup (typically under 10 minutes) without the need 
for hair washing. These systems offer higher user comfort and wireless operation, enabling mobile 
and hyperscanning recordings, but may exhibit greater variability in signal stability. 
 
From a signal quality perspective, consumer-grade EEG systems tend to perform adequately under 
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, such as event-related potential (ERP) paradigms 
conducted in controlled environments. However, their performance often degrades in real-world, 
low-SNR scenarios, particularly in mobile or naturalistic settings. Empirical evaluations indicate that 
research-grade systems, especially those with higher sensor density, yield more reliable and 
reproducible data under such conditions. These findings suggest that, despite their practical 
advantages, consumer-grade devices may be insufficient for studies requiring robust signal quality in 
ecological environments, underscoring the need for further advancements in dry-electrode 
technology to bridge this gap [8]. 
 
Reference [9] conducted a large-scale review of the technical specifications of 16 wireless EEG 
systems from multiple manufacturers. The study shows a comparative analysis of key features, 
underscoring the increasing accessibility and formal classification of wireless EEG technologies. 
 
Another study [10] presents a table of 31 devices focused on measuring brain activity related to the 
central nervous system, highlighting key market players and their most representative products. 
Reference [11] classifies 22 brain monitoring devices based on their primary applications: executive 
function, psychomotor skills, and behavioral, emotional, and sensory domains. Study selection and 
analysis were systematically conducted following the PRISMA-ScR framework.  
 
Reference [12] reports the development of a low-cost EEG system and compares commercial devices 
ranging from USD 300 to 50,000. High-end prices reflect regulatory certifications required for 
clinical use, which are often unnecessary for non-clinical BCIs. The limited availability of affordable, 
high-quality options leads researchers to rely on costly clinical-grade systems. As costs scale with 
channel count, reducing electrode number and optimizing spatial placement can improve 
cost-efficiency without compromising performance.  
 
Passive EEG electrodes transmit signals directly to the amplifier, while active electrodes incorporate 
a preamplifier. Reliable recordings require stable electrode–scalp contact, shielding against 
electromagnetic interference, and consistent signal acquisition. Improved contact enhances noise 
identification and data reliability, potentially reducing the required sample size (n). Skin impedance 
decreases from \SI{\sim200}{\kilo\ohm} (uncleaned) to \SI{\sim120}{\kilo\ohm} (cleaned), with 
further reduction achievable through exfoliation or alcohol application at the electrode site [13].  
 
Wet EEG electrodes with gel provide low impedance (\SI{<10}{\kilo\ohm}) but require skin 
preparation, electrolyte application, and cleaning. Signal quality declines as the gel dries, limiting its 
suitability for non-clinical use. Saline-based electrodes offer an alternative but may irritate abraded

skin and promote oxidation, reducing lifespan [13], [14]. Dry electrodes enable faster setup; although 
impedance is higher, advanced algorithms reduce noise and artifacts. Well-designed dry systems 
combining optimized materials, placement, and shielding can achieve signal quality comparable to 
wet systems [14], [15], [16], [17]. Silver electrodes coated with silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) remain the 
gold standard due to their corrosion resistance [18].  
 
Furthermore, low-cost EEG modules, typically compatible with open-source development platforms, 
have emerged as accessible alternatives for initial investigations, educational purposes, and 
non-clinical research. However, their limited functionality and susceptibility to noise constrain their 
use in high-precision applications [19].  
 
The common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of driven right leg (DRL) circuits is essential for minimizing 
common-mode noise in biopotential recordings. DRL systems operate by inverting the 
common-mode voltage, detected via a common-mode sense (CMS) electrode, and feeding it back to 
the participant through the DRL electrode. This negative feedback reduces interference at the 
amplifier inputs, enhancing CMRR and signal fidelity. Combined, CMS and DRL improve noise 
rejection and overall recording reliability [20].  
 
The lab streaming layer (LSL) enables precise multimodal synchronization without hardware triggers, 
supporting seamless integration with platforms such as MATLAB, Python, OpenViBE, BCI2000, and 
Unity. It synchronizes EEG, video, peripheral sensors, and stimulus markers for real-time applications, 
enhancing interoperability and scalability in research [21].  
 
The fNIRS measures cortical oxygenation and blood flow up to \SI{\sim15}{\milli\metre} depth using 
red and near-infrared light. Emitted light penetrates the scalp and skull, interacts with brain tissue, 
and is detected by infrared sensors positioned a few centimeters away. Absorption patterns, 
influenced by changes in hemoglobin saturation, allow inference of cortical activity. Red light is 
primarily absorbed by oxygenated hemoglobin, while near-infrared light reflects total blood 
concentration. Short source–detector separations minimize contamination from superficial tissues, 
enhancing signal specificity [22].  
 
Latency, response time, jitter, and throughput are key performance metrics in wireless EEG and fNIRS 
systems, influencing reliability and real-time operation. Latency is the delay from neural or 
hemodynamic activity to its digitized signal; response time adds processing delays. Jitter, or 
variability in these times, reduces temporal precision, while throughput, the rate of successful data 
transmission, often trades off with latency. Optimizing these metrics is essential for temporal 
resolution, data integrity, and real-time responsiveness [23], [24], [25], [26].

photobiomodulation (NIR-PBM).
