This scoping review provides a technical characterization of 96 wireless brain monitoring devices 
(EEG and fNIRS), totaling 125 models and variants, currently available on the global market. A 
scientific characterization was performed by systematically searching the literature following 
PRISMA guidelines and registered in the OSF. The search was conducted across five databases (IEEE, 
Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) to identify the applications of the devices tracked in 
the market. The searches were conducted between January and August 2025. A total of 5,071 
records were analyzed; 3,741 were unique entries. Among these, 2,087 studies explicitly reported 
the use of brain devices in clinical trials, dataset development, or technology evaluations, with an 
overall inclusion rate of 55.79\% after screening. Research adoption was quantified by the number of 
DOI-indexed publications referencing each device. The Epoc X leads the number of research 
publications with 19.30\%, followed by the OpenBCI system with 4.81\%, and the MindWave with 
4.06\%. Enobio appears in fourth place with 2.89\% and g.Nautilus ranks eighth with 1.71\%. These 
findings demonstrate a global effort by researchers to conduct accessible studies using user-friendly, 
low-cost, and widely available devices, revealing a significant gap between consumer-grade and 
research-grade technologies. The compiled dataset provides an evidence-based framework to guide 
neuroscientists, engineers, and clinicians in selecting the appropriate device for their specific 
research needs. This work also identifies critical trends, such as the strong convergence toward 
wireless architectures and the growing emphasis on open data interfaces.
