STATUS - Encarregado 
Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner? The manuscript thoroughly lists devices, 
specifications, bibliometric usage, and general technological considerations. However, several major 
domains expected in a “comprehensive review” are missing or insufficiently developed, such as, no inclusion 
of 2023–2025 state-of-the-art advances (e.g., EEG-transformers, multimodal AI, federated EEG learning, 
biosignal foundation models), limited discussion of translational pathways (clinical use, hospital deployment 
barriers, regulatory context, cost-effectiveness), no roadmap or identification of future research gaps. 
 
1. Inserir referências 2023–2025 estratégicas. 
2. Criar um roadmap futuro. 
3. Relacionar tecnologia, clínica e sociedade.
