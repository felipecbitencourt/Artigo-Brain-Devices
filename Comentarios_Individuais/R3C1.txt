PARCIALMENTE RESOLVIDO - claudio

The abstract states: "2,087 studies explicitly reported the use of brain devices... resulting in a true positive 
rate of 55.79%." The term "true positive rate" is typically used in classification/diagnostic contexts 
(sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)). In a literature search, this terminology is confusing. What constitutes a "false 
negative" in your search strategy? Are you referring to the precision of your search query (relevant papers / 
total retrieved papers)? Please clarify this metric. If you mean that 55.79% of the screened papers were 
relevant (i.e., actually used brain devices), use standard systematic review terminology such as "inclusion 
rate" or "relevance rate." Provide a PRISMA flow diagram showing the exact numbers at each screening 
stage. 
 
1. Substituir completamente o termo true positive rate por “inclusion rate” em todo o artigo. 
2. Inserir na seção Methods uma definição formal: 
●​
Inclusion rate = (nº de estudos que realmente usaram o dispositivo) / (nº total de registros 
recuperados). 
3. Deixar claro que: 
●​
não há “false negatives”; 
●​
trata-se de eficiência da estratégia de busca, não métrica diagnóstica. 
4. Garantir que o fluxograma PRISMA mostre: 
●​
registros recuperados; 
●​
excluídos por falso positivo (nome ambíguo, menção sem uso); 
●​
incluídos finais.

Response To Reviewers 
We agree with the reviewer that the term true positive rate is inappropriate in the context of a 
literature search. The manuscript has been revised to replace this term with inclusion rate, which 
is consistent with systematic review terminology. The inclusion rate is now explicitly defined in the 
Methods section as the proportion of retrieved records that explicitly applied the named brain 
device as an experimental or clinical tool, reflecting the precision of the device-specific search 
queries, rather than sensitivity or recall. The Abstract and Results sections were updated 
accordingly to report that 2,087 of 3,741 unique records met the inclusion criteria, yielding an 
overall inclusion rate of 55.79%. A PRISMA flow diagram has also been added to report the 
number of records retrieved, duplicates removed, records screened, and studies included at each 
stage.
