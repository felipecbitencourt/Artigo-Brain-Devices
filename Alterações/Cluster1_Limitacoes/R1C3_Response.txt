R1C3 - VIÉS DE DADOS DE FABRICANTES
================================================================================

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"How do the authors address the potential bias introduced by manufacturer-
provided specifications, particularly for parameters such as sampling rate, 
resolution, and wireless performance?"

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS:
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for raising this important methodological concern. 
We acknowledge that the reliance on manufacturer-provided specifications 
introduces potential bias, as these parameters may be optimized for 
marketing purposes rather than scientific transparency.

To address this limitation, we have made the following revisions:

1. **Explicit acknowledgment in text:** The Limitations section now 
   explicitly states that device specifications were compiled from 
   manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, and secondary literature, 
   rather than from independent laboratory testing.

2. **Bias disclosure:** A dedicated paragraph addresses the potential 
   bias introduced by manufacturer-provided data, noting that parameters 
   such as signal-to-noise ratio, latency, and impedance are rarely 
   disclosed in standardized formats.

3. **Interpretive guidance:** We advise readers that these specifications 
   serve as reference points for initial comparison rather than validated 
   performance metrics.

AÇÕES:
================================================================================
1. Identificar nas tabelas quais dados vêm de fabricantes vs. artigos
2. Marcar claramente dados apenas declarados pelo fabricante
3. Acrescentar parágrafo em Limitations sobre esse viés
