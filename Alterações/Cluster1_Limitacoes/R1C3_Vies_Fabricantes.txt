COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
How do the authors address the potential bias introduced by manufacturer-provided specifications, particularly 
for parameters such as sampling rate, resolution, and wireless performance?

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for raising this important concern. We have addressed this by:

1. Adding a Limitations paragraph: Acknowledging that specifications were compiled from manufacturer documentation 
   and may not represent independent validation.

2. Clarifying data sources in Methods: Stating that data came from technical manuals, websites, and secondary 
   literature.

3. Recommending future work: Suggesting experimental benchmarking studies for independent validation.

--- Manufacturer Data Bias (R1C3) ---

The reliance on manufacturer-provided data introduces potential bias, as specifications may be optimized for 
marketing purposes rather than scientific transparency. Parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, latency, and 
impedance are rarely disclosed in standardized formats, limiting direct cross-device comparisons. These 
limitations should be considered when interpreting device specifications presented in this review.
