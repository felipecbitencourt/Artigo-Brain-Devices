COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"Add a 'Limitations & Future Work' section."

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We have added a dedicated "Limitations and Future Directions" 
section positioned before the Conclusion, addressing:

1. Absence of experimental benchmarking or signal quality validation
2. Reliance on manufacturer-provided specifications
3. No direct clinical evaluation
4. Limitations of publication-based adoption metrics
5. Rapidly evolving market (data as of August 2025)
6. Future research priorities (benchmarking, AI integration, clinical validation, longitudinal tracking, 
   standardized reporting)

TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
================================================================================
(Inserir antes da seção Conclusion)

This scoping review has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the study did not include 
experimental benchmarking or direct signal quality validation. Device specifications were compiled from 
manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, and secondary literature, rather than from independent laboratory 
testing.

Second, the reliance on manufacturer-provided data introduces potential bias, as specifications may be optimized 
for marketing purposes rather than scientific transparency.

Third, no direct clinical evaluation was performed. The review focused on technical characterization and research 
adoption patterns rather than therapeutic efficacy or patient outcomes.

Fourth, the use of DOI-indexed publication counts as an adoption proxy captures documented academic use but does 
not account for unpublished research, proprietary industrial applications, or clinical deployments outside 
peer-reviewed contexts.

Finally, the neurotechnology market evolves rapidly. Devices included in this review reflect commercial 
availability as of August 2025, and new products, firmware updates, or discontinued models may alter the 
landscape in subsequent years.

---

Future research should address these limitations through: (1) experimental benchmarking studies comparing signal 
quality and reliability across devices; (2) integration with AI and machine learning for real-time applications; 
(3) clinical validation studies in neurorehabilitation; (4) longitudinal tracking of market evolution; and 
(5) development of standardized reporting frameworks for neurotechnology specifications.
