R2C6 - LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
================================================================================
Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
Add a "Limitations & Future Work" section.

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We have added a dedicated "Limitations and Future Directions" 
section positioned before the Conclusion, addressing:

1. Absence of experimental benchmarking or signal quality validation
2. Reliance on manufacturer-provided specifications
3. No direct clinical evaluation
4. Limitations of publication-based adoption metrics
5. Rapidly evolving market (data as of August 2025)
6. Future research priorities

SEÇÃO: LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

--- Experimental Benchmarking (R2C6) ---

First, the study did not include experimental benchmarking or direct signal quality validation. Device 
specifications were compiled from manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, and secondary literature, rather 
than from independent laboratory testing.

--- Clinical Validation (R2C6) ---

Third, no direct clinical evaluation was performed. The review focused on technical characterization and research 
adoption patterns rather than therapeutic efficacy or patient outcomes.

--- Publication-Based Metrics (R2C6) ---

Fourth, the use of DOI-indexed publication counts as an adoption proxy captures documented academic use but does 
not account for unpublished research, proprietary industrial applications, or clinical deployments outside 
peer-reviewed contexts.

--- Market Temporality (R2C6) ---

Finally, the neurotechnology market evolves rapidly. Devices included in this review reflect commercial 
availability as of August 2025, and new products, firmware updates, or discontinued models may alter the 
landscape in subsequent years.

================================================================================
SEÇÃO: FUTURE DIRECTIONS
================================================================================

--- Research Priorities (R2C6) ---

Future research should address these limitations through: (1) experimental benchmarking studies comparing signal 
quality and reliability across devices; (2) integration with AI and machine learning for real-time applications; 
(3) clinical validation studies in neurorehabilitation; (4) longitudinal tracking of market evolution; and 
(5) development of standardized reporting frameworks for neurotechnology specifications.
