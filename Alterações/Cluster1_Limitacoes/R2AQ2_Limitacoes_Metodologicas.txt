COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"The methodology section could benefit from explicitly stating the limitations of the review approach."

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have:

1. Added explicit limitations in the Methods section regarding data collection approach.
2. Expanded the Limitations section with methodological constraints.
3. Clarified the scope as a scoping review rather than systematic validation study.

TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - METHODS (adicionar ao final)
================================================================================

This scoping review is subject to methodological limitations inherent to the catalog approach. Device 
specifications were compiled from publicly available sources (manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, 
peer-reviewed publications) rather than from independent laboratory testing. Consequently, reported parameters 
reflect manufacturer claims and may not fully represent real-world performance.

================================================================================
TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

From a methodological perspective, the catalog approach prioritized breadth of coverage over depth of validation. 
While this enables comprehensive market mapping, it does not substitute for empirical benchmarking studies that 
would provide independent verification of device specifications under controlled conditions.
