R2AQ2 - LIMITAÇÕES METODOLÓGICAS

Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
Is the paper technically sound? Partially, with methodological gaps that weaken its rigor. There is no 
benchmarking, device validation, or SNR/latency/impedance comparative analysis, lack of reproducibility 
information (reviewer count, exclusion rules, search strings), reliance on self-reported manufacturer data 
without verification.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this critical assessment. We have:

1. Added explicit limitations in the Methods section regarding data collection approach.
2. Expanded the Limitations section with methodological constraints.
3. Clarified the scope as a scoping review rather than systematic validation study.

SEÇÃO: METHODS
================================================================================

--- Methodological Constraints (R2AQ2) ---

This scoping review is subject to methodological limitations inherent to the catalog approach. Device 
specifications were compiled from publicly available sources (manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, 
peer-reviewed publications) rather than from independent laboratory testing. Consequently, reported parameters 
reflect manufacturer claims and may not fully represent real-world performance.

================================================================================
SEÇÃO: LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

--- Methodological Scope (R2AQ2) ---

From a methodological perspective, the catalog approach prioritized breadth of coverage over depth of validation. 
While this enables comprehensive market mapping, it does not substitute for empirical benchmarking studies that 
would provide independent verification of device specifications under controlled conditions.
