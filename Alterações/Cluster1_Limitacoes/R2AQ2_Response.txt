R2AQ2 - LIMITAÇÕES METODOLÓGICAS GERAIS
================================================================================

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"Is the paper technically sound? Partially, with methodological gaps that 
weaken its rigor. There is no benchmarking, device validation, or SNR/
latency/impedance comparative analysis, lack of reproducibility information, 
reliance on self-reported manufacturer data without verification."

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS:
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this critical assessment. We acknowledge the 
methodological constraints identified and clarify the intended scope of 
this work.

**Acknowledgment of limitations:**

1. **No experimental benchmarking:** This scoping review focuses on 
   compiling publicly available technical specifications rather than 
   conducting experimental validation. The absence of benchmarking 
   reflects the scope of a scoping review (PRISMA-ScR), which aims 
   to map available evidence rather than generate new empirical data.

2. **Manufacturer-provided data:** We explicitly acknowledge in the 
   revised Limitations section that specifications were compiled from 
   manufacturer sources and may contain bias.

3. **Reproducibility information:** The study is registered in the 
   OSF, and the supplementary material includes the complete device 
   catalog with sources.

**Justification of methodological choices:**

The decision to rely on manufacturer specifications rather than 
conducting experimental benchmarking was deliberate and appropriate 
for a scoping review of this scale. Benchmarking 96 devices would 
require physical access to all devices, standardized protocols, and 
substantial funding. The present work provides the foundational 
mapping that can guide future targeted benchmarking efforts.
