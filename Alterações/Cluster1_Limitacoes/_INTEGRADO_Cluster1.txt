================================================================================

Following the recommendations of Reviewers 1 and 2 regarding methodological 
limitations (R1C3, R2C6, R2AQ2), we have added a dedicated "Limitations and 
Future Directions" section that explicitly addresses:

1. **Absence of experimental benchmarking** (R2C6, R2AQ2)
2. **Potential bias from manufacturer-provided data** (R1C3, R2AQ2)
3. **No clinical validation** (R2C6)
4. **Limitations of DOI-indexed publication counts** (R2C6)
5. **Rapidly evolving market** (R2C6)

Limitations and Future Directions

This scoping review has several limitations that should be acknowledged. 
First, the study did not include experimental benchmarking or direct 
signal quality validation. Device specifications were compiled from 
manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, and secondary literature, 
rather than from independent laboratory testing. As a result, reported 
parameters such as sampling rate, resolution, and wireless performance 
reflect manufacturer claims and may not fully represent real-world 
performance under varying conditions.

Second, the reliance on manufacturer-provided data introduces potential 
bias, as specifications may be optimized for marketing purposes rather 
than scientific transparency. Parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, 
latency, and impedance are rarely disclosed in standardized formats, 
limiting direct cross-device comparisons.

Third, no direct clinical evaluation was performed. The review focused 
on technical characterization and research adoption patterns rather than 
therapeutic efficacy or patient outcomes. Clinical applicability should 
be inferred cautiously, and device selection for clinical use requires 
additional validation beyond the scope of this review.

Fourth, the use of DOI-indexed publication counts as a proxy for research 
adoption has inherent limitations. This metric does not account for 
industry-specific publishing practices, as some manufacturers may actively 
encourage academic publications while others focus on commercial or 
clinical markets. Device cost and accessibility influence publication 
frequency; lower-cost, consumer-grade devices may appear more frequently 
in the literature due to broader accessibility, particularly in 
resource-limited research settings. The availability of open-source 
software, datasets, and community support for specific devices may also 
inflate publication counts independently of hardware performance. 
Furthermore, this metric captures only documented academic use and does 
not reflect unpublished research, proprietary industrial applications, 
or clinical deployments outside peer-reviewed contexts. Readers should 
interpret adoption metrics as indicators of documented research use 
rather than endorsements of device quality.

Finally, the neurotechnology market evolves rapidly. Devices included 
in this review reflect commercial availability as of August 2025, and 
new products, firmware updates, or discontinued models may alter the 
landscape in subsequent years.

Future research should address these limitations through several 
complementary approaches. First, experimental benchmarking studies 
are needed to systematically compare signal quality, noise spectral 
profiles, dropout rates, and operational reliability across devices 
under controlled conditions.

Second, the integration of brain monitoring devices with artificial 
intelligence and machine learning pipelines represents a critical 
frontier. Future work should evaluate device compatibility with 
real-time classification algorithms, adaptive neurofeedback systems, 
and closed-loop brain-computer interfaces.

Third, clinical validation studies in neurorehabilitation settings 
are essential to assess the translational potential of portable 
neurotechnologies.

Fourth, longitudinal tracking of device adoption and technological 
evolution would enable trend analysis and inform predictions about 
future market developments.

Finally, the development of standardized reporting frameworks for 
neurotechnology specifications would enhance transparency and 
facilitate cross-study comparisons.
