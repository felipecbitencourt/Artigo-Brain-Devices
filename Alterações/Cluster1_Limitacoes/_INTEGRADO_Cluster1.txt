RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the Reviewers for their insightful comments regarding methodological limitations. Following their 
recommendations (R1C3, R2C6, R2AQ2), we have substantially revised the manuscript to include a dedicated 
"Limitations and Future Directions" section addressing:

1. Absence of experimental benchmarking (R2C6, R2AQ2)
2. Potential bias from manufacturer-provided data (R1C3, R2AQ2)
3. No clinical validation (R2C6)
4. Limitations of publication-based adoption metrics (R2C6)
5. Rapidly evolving market (R2C6)

SEÇÃO: LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

--- Experimental Benchmarking (R2C6, R2AQ2) ---

First, the study did not include experimental benchmarking or direct signal quality validation. Device 
specifications were compiled from manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, and secondary literature, rather 
than from independent laboratory testing. As a result, reported parameters such as sampling rate, resolution, and 
wireless performance reflect manufacturer claims and may not fully represent real-world performance under varying 
conditions.

--- Manufacturer Data Bias (R1C3, R2AQ2) ---

Second, the reliance on manufacturer-provided data introduces potential bias, as specifications may be optimized 
for marketing purposes rather than scientific transparency. Parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, latency, 
and impedance are rarely disclosed in standardized formats, limiting direct cross-device comparisons.

--- Clinical Validation (R2C6) ---

Third, no direct clinical evaluation was performed. The review focused on technical characterization and research 
adoption patterns rather than therapeutic efficacy or patient outcomes. Clinical applicability should be inferred 
cautiously, and device selection for clinical use requires additional validation beyond the scope of this review.

--- Publication-Based Metrics (R2C6) ---

Fourth, the use of DOI-indexed publication counts as an adoption proxy captures documented academic use but does 
not account for unpublished research, proprietary industrial applications, or clinical deployments outside 
peer-reviewed contexts. Additionally, publication frequency may be influenced by device cost, accessibility, and 
manufacturer support rather than technical merit.

--- Market Temporality (R2C6) ---

Finally, the neurotechnology market evolves rapidly. Devices included in this review reflect commercial 
availability as of August 2025, and new products, firmware updates, or discontinued models may alter the 
landscape in subsequent years.

SEÇÃO: FUTURE DIRECTIONS
================================================================================

--- Research Priorities (R2C6) ---

Future research should address these limitations through: (1) experimental benchmarking studies comparing signal 
quality and reliability across devices; (2) integration with AI and machine learning for real-time applications; 
(3) clinical validation studies in neurorehabilitation; (4) longitudinal tracking of market evolution; and 
(5) development of standardized reporting frameworks for neurotechnology specifications.
