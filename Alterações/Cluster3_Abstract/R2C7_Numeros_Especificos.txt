--- Results (R2C7) ---

A total of 96 unique devices (125 including model variants) from 64 manufacturers across 26 countries were 
identified. Bibliometric analysis yielded 3,741 unique records, of which 2,087 (55.79%) met the inclusion 
criteria, explicitly reporting device use in experimental or clinical applications. The Emotiv EPOC X led 
research adoption with 19.30% of included studies. The research adoption distribution exhibited high 
concentration (Gini coefficient = 0.86), with the top 5 devices accounting for 55.4% of all documented studies.
