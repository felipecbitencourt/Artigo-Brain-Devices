Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"Why is this a descriptive scoping review rather than a systematic review with meta-analysis?"

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this methodological question. We have:

1. Clarified scope in Methods: This is a scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, designed for technical 
   characterization rather than hypothesis testing.

2. Justified approach: The heterogeneity of device specifications and lack of standardized outcomes preclude 
   meta-analysis.

3. Stated objective: Mapping the commercial landscape and research adoption patterns, not evaluating 
   comparative efficacy.

TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - METHODS
================================================================================

This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in the Open Science Framework. 
The scoping review methodology was selected because the objective was to map the commercial landscape and 
quantify research adoption patterns, rather than to synthesize intervention effects or test hypotheses. The 
heterogeneity of device specifications, absence of standardized performance metrics, and lack of head-to-head 
comparative studies preclude traditional meta-analytical approaches.
