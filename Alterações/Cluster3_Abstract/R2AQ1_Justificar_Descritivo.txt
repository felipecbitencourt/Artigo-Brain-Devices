R2AQ1 - JUSTIFICAR CARÁTER DESCRITIVO
================================================================================
Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge? The manuscript contributes a valuable market-mapping dataset 
of 96 wireless EEG and fNIRS devices (125 including variants), compiled via a PRISMA-ScR protocol and OSF 
registration. This large-scale technical catalog is useful for researchers making device-selection decisions. 
However, its scientific advancement is limited, because the paper is primarily descriptive and does not provide 
critical synthesis, benchmarking, or analytical interpretation of device performance, clinical applicability, or 
research validation.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this methodological question. We have:

1. Clarified scope in Methods: This is a scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, designed for technical 
   characterization rather than hypothesis testing.

2. Justified approach: The heterogeneity of device specifications and lack of standardized outcomes preclude 
   meta-analysis.

3. Stated objective: Mapping the commercial landscape and research adoption patterns, not evaluating 
   comparative efficacy.

--- Scoping Review Justification (R2AQ1) ---

This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in the Open Science Framework. 
The scoping review methodology was selected because the objective was to map the commercial landscape and 
quantify research adoption patterns, rather than to synthesize intervention effects or test hypotheses. The 
heterogeneity of device specifications, absence of standardized performance metrics, and lack of head-to-head 
comparative studies preclude traditional meta-analytical approaches.
