COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge? The manuscript provides 
a systematic, market-orientated review of portable and wireless devices for 
EEG and fNIRS brain monitoring currently available worldwide. The collection 
of 96 devices and the quantification of their adoption in research through 
DOI-indexed publications represent an original and valuable resource for 
neuroscientists, biomedical engineers, and clinicians. The work offers an 
evidence-based mapping of the commercial landscape of neurotechnologies, 
thereby filling a recognised gap between engineering specifications and 
practical research implementation."

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (INGLÊS):
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for recognizing the original contribution of this work. 
To ensure that the manuscript clearly communicates its novelty and practical 
value, we have made the following revisions:

1. **Abstract revision:** The Abstract now explicitly states the original 
   contribution: a systematic characterization of 96 commercially available 
   wireless brain monitoring devices (125 including variants), combined with 
   bibliometric indicators of research adoption. We emphasize that this work 
   bridges the gap between engineering specifications and practical research 
   implementation.

2. **Introduction enhancement:** A dedicated paragraph has been added to the 
   Introduction articulating the unique contribution of this review:
   - Comprehensive catalog of 96 commercial EEG and fNIRS devices
   - Integration of technical specifications with documented research use
   - Evidence-based framework to guide device selection for neuroscience 
     and neurorehabilitation applications

3. **Metric clarification:** Throughout the manuscript, we now consistently 
   clarify that DOI-indexed publication counts serve as indicators of 
   documented use in the scientific literature, rather than measures of 
   device quality or performance.

4. **Discussion synthesis:** A paragraph has been added to the Discussion 
   section explaining why this technical mapping is valuable for researchers 
   and clinicians making device selection decisions.

--- ABSTRACT (revisar para incluir) ---

"This scoping review provides a comprehensive technical characterization of 
96 wireless brain monitoring devices (EEG and fNIRS), totaling 125 models 
and variants, currently available on the global market. A bibliometric 
analysis was performed to quantify research adoption through DOI-indexed 
publications. [...]

The compiled dataset provides an evidence-based framework to guide 
neuroscientists, engineers, and clinicians in selecting the appropriate 
device for their specific research needs, bridging the gap between 
engineering specifications and practical research implementation."


--- INTRODUCTION (adicionar parágrafo antes da pergunta de pesquisa) ---

"To address this gap, the present work provides a large-scale, device-level 
mapping and technical characterization of commercially available EEG and 
fNIRS systems relevant to neuroscience and neurorehabilitation research. 
Unlike prior reviews that focus primarily on signal processing methods, 
experimental paradigms, or limited subsets of devices, this study 
systematically catalogs 96 commercially available systems (125 including 
model variants) using manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, and 
secondary literature. The resulting framework integrates engineering 
specifications with application-oriented criteria and bibliometric 
indicators of device adoption in the literature. By combining technical, 
applicational, and adoption-level perspectives, this review offers a 
translationally oriented resource that fills a recognized gap between 
engineering specifications and practical research implementation."


--- INTRODUCTION (frase adicional sobre a métrica) ---

"Research adoption was quantified through the number of DOI-indexed 
publications explicitly reporting device use, serving as an indicator 
of documented utilization in the scientific community rather than a 
measure of device quality or technical superiority."


--- DISCUSSION (parágrafo de síntese) ---

"The technical mapping presented in this review addresses a practical 
need within the neuroscience and neurorehabilitation communities. 
Researchers and clinicians often face significant challenges when 
selecting brain monitoring devices, as technical specifications are 
dispersed across manufacturer websites, product manuals, and 
fragmented literature. By consolidating this information into a 
unified, evidence-based framework, this review enables informed 
decision-making that aligns device capabilities with specific 
methodological and operational requirements. The integration of 
bibliometric adoption indicators further supports this process by 
identifying devices with established track records in peer-reviewed 
research, reducing the risk of selecting systems with limited 
independent validation. This resource is particularly valuable for 
institutions establishing new neurophysiology laboratories, 
researchers designing multisite studies requiring standardized 
equipment, and clinicians seeking portable solutions for 
neurorehabilitation applications outside traditional clinical settings."
