COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge? The manuscript provides a systematic, market-orientated 
review of portable and wireless devices for EEG and fNIRS brain monitoring currently available worldwide. The 
collection of 96 devices and the quantification of their adoption in research through DOI-indexed publications 
represent an original and valuable resource for neuroscientists, biomedical engineers, and clinicians. The work 
offers an evidence-based mapping of the commercial landscape of neurotechnologies, thereby filling a recognised 
gap between engineering specifications and practical research implementation.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for recognizing the contribution of this work. We have:

1. Added explicit contribution statement in the Conclusion: Emphasizing this is the most comprehensive 
   device-level mapping currently available.

2. Clarified unique value: 96 devices, 64 manufacturers, 26 countries, with both technical specifications 
   and research adoption metrics.

3. Distinguished from prior reviews: Previous reviews focused on specific applications or technologies; 
   this review provides cross-device comparison framework.
