RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the Reviewers for their recommendations regarding the Abstract. Following their comments (R1AQ1, R2C7, 
R2AQ1), we have substantially revised the Abstract to include:

1. Specific quantitative achievements (R2C7): 96 devices, 64 manufacturers, 26 countries, Gini 0.86.
2. Clear statement of contribution (R1AQ1): Evidence-based framework for device selection.
3. Justification of descriptive scope (R2AQ1): Scoping review methodology clarified.

SEÇÃO: ABSTRACT
================================================================================

--- Background (R2AQ1) ---

The proliferation of portable brain monitoring devices for electroencephalography (EEG) and functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has created both opportunities and challenges for neuroscience and 
neurorehabilitation research. Device selection remains a methodological challenge due to heterogeneous 
specifications and lack of standardized comparison frameworks.

--- Objective (R2AQ1) ---

This scoping review provides a comprehensive technical characterization of wireless brain monitoring devices 
currently available on the global market and quantifies their adoption in the scientific literature.

--- Methods (R2AQ1) ---

Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF), we systematically identified 
and characterized commercially available EEG and fNIRS devices. Research adoption was quantified through 
DOI-indexed publications explicitly reporting device use. An annualized adoption rate was calculated to account 
for differences in device age.

--- Results (R2C7) ---

A total of 96 unique devices (125 including model variants) from 64 manufacturers across 26 countries were 
identified. Bibliometric analysis yielded 3,741 unique records, of which 2,087 (55.79%) met the inclusion 
criteria, explicitly reporting device use in experimental or clinical applications. The Emotiv EPOC X led 
research adoption with 19.30% of included studies (722 publications; 120.33 articles/year). The research adoption 
distribution exhibited high concentration (Gini coefficient = 0.86), with the top 5 devices accounting for 55.4% 
of all documented studies.

--- Conclusion (R1AQ1) ---

This review provides the most comprehensive device-level mapping of portable brain monitoring technologies 
currently available in the peer-reviewed literature. The compiled catalog offers an evidence-based framework to 
guide device selection, bridging the gap between engineering specifications and practical research implementation.
