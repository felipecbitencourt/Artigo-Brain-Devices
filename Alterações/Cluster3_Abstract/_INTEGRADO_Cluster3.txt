RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (UNIFICADA):
================================================================================

Following the recommendations of Reviewers 1 and 2 regarding the Abstract 
(R1AQ1, R2C7, R2AQ1), we have substantially revised the Abstract to include:

1. **Specific quantitative achievements** (R2C7): 96 devices, 125 variants, 
   2,087 studies, 55.79% inclusion rate
2. **Clear statement of contribution** (R1AQ1): Evidence-based framework 
   for device selection
3. **Justification of descriptive scope** (R2AQ1): Valid scoping review 
   methodology

ABSTRACT REVISADO:
================================================================================

Background: The proliferation of portable brain monitoring devices for 
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
(fNIRS) has created both opportunities and challenges for neuroscience 
and neurorehabilitation research. Device selection remains a methodological 
challenge due to heterogeneous specifications and lack of standardized 
comparison frameworks.

Objective: This scoping review provides a comprehensive technical 
characterization of wireless brain monitoring devices currently available 
on the global market and quantifies their adoption in the scientific 
literature.

Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in the Open 
Science Framework (OSF), we systematically identified and characterized 
commercially available EEG and fNIRS devices. Research adoption was 
quantified through DOI-indexed publications explicitly reporting device 
use. An annualized adoption rate was calculated to account for differences 
in device age.

Results: A total of 96 unique devices (125 including model variants) 
from [X] manufacturers across [Y] countries were identified. Bibliometric 
analysis yielded 3,741 unique records, of which 2,087 (55.79%) met the 
inclusion criteria, explicitly reporting device use in experimental or 
clinical applications. The Emotiv EPOC/EPOC X led research adoption 
with [N]% of included studies, followed by OpenBCI ([N]%) and NeuroSky 
MindWave ([N]%).

Conclusion: This review provides the most comprehensive device-level 
mapping of portable brain monitoring technologies currently available 
in the peer-reviewed literature. The compiled catalog offers an 
evidence-based framework to guide device selection, bridging the gap 
between engineering specifications and practical research implementation.
