RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (UNIFICADA):
================================================================================

Following the recommendations of Reviewers 1 and 3 regarding adoption 
metrics and temporal analysis (R1C1, R3C5, R3C6), we have made 
substantial revisions including:

1. **Time-normalized metrics** (R1C1): Annualized publication rate
2. **Temporal evolution analysis** (R3C5): Timeline figure, trend analysis
3. **Variant handling clarification** (R3C6): Aggregation strategy explained

--- METHODS (normalização temporal - R1C1) ---

"Research adoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications 
explicitly reporting the use of each device. This metric serves as a 
literature-based proxy for adoption within the scientific community, 
reflecting documented use rather than device quality. To account for 
differences in device age, an annualized adoption rate was calculated 
by dividing the total publication count by the number of years since 
each device's market entry."

--- METHODS (tratamento de variantes - R3C6) ---

"Device variants were handled using a hybrid approach. At the catalog 
level, unique device families were identified based on manufacturer 
naming conventions. When variants exhibited distinct specifications, 
they were recorded as separate entries (resulting in 125 entries from 
96 device families). For bibliometric analysis, publication counts 
were aggregated at the device family level to avoid fragmentation."

--- RESULTS (evolução temporal - R3C5) ---

"Figure X presents the timeline of market entry for the 96 devices. 
The average channel count has increased over time, from [X] channels 
(2009-2012) to [Y] channels (2020-2025). Cost per channel has decreased, 
with current consumer-grade devices achieving costs below $50 per channel. 
Wireless connectivity has become dominant, exceeding [Z]% for devices 
released after 2020."
