RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the Reviewers for their recommendations regarding adoption metrics and temporal analysis. Following 
their comments (R1C1, R3C5, R3C6), we have substantially revised the manuscript to include:

1. Time-normalized metrics (R1C1): Annualized publication rates alongside raw counts.
2. Temporal evolution analysis (R3C5): Trend analysis covering 2008-2025.
3. Gini coefficient (R3C3): Research adoption concentration quantified.
4. Variant handling clarification (R3C6): Device family aggregation explained.
5. Year of first appearance methodology (R1C1, R3C5): Multi-source strategy described.

--- Research Adoption Metrics (R1C1) ---

Research adoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications explicitly reporting the use of each 
device in experimental or clinical applications. This metric serves as a literature-based proxy for adoption 
within the scientific community, reflecting documented use rather than device quality or technical performance.

To account for differences in device age, an annualized adoption rate was calculated by dividing the total 
publication count by the number of years since each device's market entry. Market entry dates were available for 
92 of 96 devices (95.8%), spanning from 2008 to 2025.

--- Year of First Appearance (R1C1, R3C5) ---

Release year information was not consistently disclosed by manufacturers for a substantial portion of the devices. 
Consequently, a secondary strategy based on the year of first appearance was adopted. This strategy integrated 
multiple indicators, including official manufacturer documentation, the earliest peer-reviewed publications 
reporting device usage, presentations at scientific or industry events, and, when applicable, the year of first 
clearance or approval by the relevant regulatory authority (e.g., FDA, CE marking), among other verifiable 
milestones. For devices that underwent subsequent updates, revisions, or new versions, the earliest identifiable 
date of public availability was considered.

--- Device Variant Handling (R3C6) ---

Devices were organized based on form factor (device type) as the primary grouping criterion. Within the same 
manufacturer, devices sharing identical form factors but differing in channel count or minor configurations were 
grouped as variants within a single entry (e.g., "Quick 20m | 20r v2 | 32r" representing the same headset design 
with 20, 21, or 32 channels). Conversely, devices with fundamentally different form factors were recorded as 
separate entries, even from the same manufacturer (e.g., CGX Cognionics "Quick" headset vs. "Mobile" cap).

This aggregation strategy was also adopted because many publications do not specify the exact variant used. 
Authors frequently report using "Emotiv EPOC" or "OpenBCI" without distinguishing specific models or 
configurations. Aggregating at the device family level provides more stable adoption indicators and avoids 
artificial fragmentation of citation counts.

--- Temporal Evolution of the Neurotechnology Market (R3C5) ---

Figure X presents the timeline of market entry for the 96 devices identified in this review. The market has shown 
accelerating growth, with 63.6% of all devices (61 of 96) entering the market between 2019 and 2025.

The distribution of device market entries across time periods was as follows: 2008-2014 (8 devices, 8.3%), 
2015-2018 (23 devices, 24.0%), 2019-2022 (35 devices, 36.5%), and 2023-2025 (26 devices, 27.1%).

--- Channel Count Evolution (R3C5) ---

The average channel count increased from 24.9 (2008-2014) to 27.4 (2015-2018), then stabilized around 22-24 
channels (2019-2025). This pattern reflects the simultaneous growth of two market segments: high-density research 
systems (32-128+ channels) and consumer-grade devices (1-8 channels).

--- Wireless Adoption (R3C5) ---

Wireless connectivity has become the dominant architecture since 2015, with approximately 70% of devices featuring 
Bluetooth connectivity across all subsequent periods: 2008-2014 (62.5% Bluetooth, 12.5% Wi-Fi), 2015-2018 (73.9% 
Bluetooth, 34.8% Wi-Fi), 2019-2022 (71.4% Bluetooth, 31.4% Wi-Fi), and 2023-2025 (69.2% Bluetooth, 19.2% Wi-Fi).

--- Research Adoption Concentration (R1C1, R3C3) ---

The research adoption distribution exhibited high concentration (Gini coefficient = 0.86), with the top 5 devices 
accounting for 55.4% of all documented studies (1,157 of 2,087). The Emotiv EPOC X led research adoption with 
120.33 articles/year (722 total studies over 6 years).

When normalized by years since market entry, adoption velocity reveals that recently released devices such as 
NirSmart (24.50 articles/year) and Emotiv Flex 2 (18.00 articles/year) exhibit high annual adoption rates despite 
lower absolute counts, suggesting growing research interest in newer technologies.
