RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (UNIFICADA):
================================================================================

Following the recommendations of Reviewers 1 and 3 regarding adoption 
metrics and temporal analysis (R1C1, R3C5, R3C6), we have made 
substantial revisions including:

1. **Time-normalized metrics** (R1C1): Annualized publication rate calculated 
   for 57 devices with complete data
2. **Temporal evolution analysis** (R3C5): Trend analysis covering 2008-2025
3. **Variant handling clarification** (R3C6): Aggregation strategy explained
4. **Concentration analysis** (R3C3): Gini coefficient = 0.8568

--- METHODS (normalização temporal - R1C1) ---

"Research adoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications 
explicitly reporting the use of each device. This metric serves as a 
literature-based proxy for adoption within the scientific community, 
reflecting documented use rather than device quality. To account for 
differences in device age, an annualized adoption rate was calculated 
by dividing the total publication count by the number of years since 
each device's market entry. Market entry dates were available for 92 
of 96 devices (95.8%), spanning from 2008 to 2025.

Release year information was not consistently disclosed by manufacturers 
for a substantial portion of the devices. Consequently, a secondary 
strategy based on the year of first appearance was adopted. This strategy 
integrated multiple indicators, including official manufacturer documentation, 
the earliest peer-reviewed publications reporting device usage, presentations 
at scientific or industry events, and, when applicable, the year of first 
clearance or approval by the relevant regulatory authority (e.g., FDA, CE 
marking), among other verifiable milestones. For devices that underwent 
subsequent updates, revisions, or new versions, the earliest identifiable 
date of public availability was considered."

--- METHODS (tratamento de variantes - R3C6) ---

"Device variants were handled using a hybrid approach. At the catalog 
level, unique device families were identified based on manufacturer 
naming conventions. When variants exhibited distinct specifications, 
they were recorded as separate entries (resulting in 125 entries from 
96 device families). For bibliometric analysis, publication counts 
were aggregated at the device family level to avoid fragmentation."

--- RESULTS (evolução temporal - R3C5) ---

"Figure X presents the timeline of market entry for the 96 devices. 
The market has shown accelerating growth, with 63.6% of devices entering 
the market since 2019. The average channel count increased from 24.9 
(2008-2014) to 27.4 (2015-2018), then stabilized around 22-24 channels 
(2019-2025). Wireless connectivity has become dominant, with approximately 
70% of devices featuring Bluetooth connectivity across all periods since 
2015. The research adoption distribution exhibited high concentration 
(Gini coefficient = 0.86), with the top 5 devices accounting for 55.4% 
of all documented studies."
