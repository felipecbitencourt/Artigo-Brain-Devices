R1C1 - NORMALIZAÇÃO DA MÉTRICA DOI
================================================================================
Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
How do the authors justify the use of the "number of DOI-indexed publications" as a proxy for device adoption 
without normalising device age, year of market entry, or industry-specific publishing practices?

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this important methodological concern. We have addressed this limitation by:

1. Clarifying metric purpose in Methods: We now explicitly state that DOI-indexed publications serve as an 
   indicator of documented use, not device quality or technical performance.

2. Revising terminology: We replaced ambiguous terms with "research adoption" and "literature-based adoption proxy."

3. Adding time-normalized analysis: We calculated annualized publication rates (articles/year since market entry) 
   for 92 of 96 devices (95.8%).

4. Creating a comparative table (Table X): Presenting both total publications and annualized rates.

5. Adding concentration analysis: Gini coefficient (0.86) quantifying adoption inequality.

6. Adding a Limitations paragraph: Acknowledging factors that may influence publication counts.

--- Research Adoption Metrics (R1C1) ---

Research adoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications explicitly reporting the use of each 
device in experimental or clinical applications. This metric serves as a literature-based proxy for adoption 
within the scientific community, reflecting documented use rather than device quality or technical performance.

To account for differences in device age, an annualized adoption rate was calculated by dividing the total 
publication count by the number of years since each device's market entry. Market entry dates were available for 
92 of 96 devices (95.8%), spanning from 2008 to 2025.

--- Year of First Appearance (R1C1) ---

Release year information was not consistently disclosed by manufacturers for a substantial portion of the devices. 
Consequently, a secondary strategy based on the year of first appearance was adopted. This strategy integrated 
multiple indicators, including official manufacturer documentation, the earliest peer-reviewed publications 
reporting device usage, presentations at scientific or industry events, and, when applicable, the year of first 
clearance or approval by the relevant regulatory authority (e.g., FDA, CE marking), among other verifiable 
milestones.

--- Research Adoption Concentration (R1C1) ---

Table X presents the research adoption metrics for the identified devices. The Emotiv EPOC X leads in total 
publications (n = 722, 19.30%). When normalized by years since market entry, adoption velocity reveals different 
patterns: recently released devices such as NirSmart (24.50 articles/year) and Emotiv Flex 2 (18.00 articles/year) 
exhibit high annual adoption rates despite lower absolute counts.

The research adoption distribution is highly concentrated, with a Gini coefficient of 0.86. The top 5 devices 
account for 55.4% of all identified studies (1,157 of 2,087).

SEÇÃO: LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

--- Publication-Based Metrics (R1C1) ---

The use of DOI-indexed publication counts as a proxy for research adoption has inherent limitations. This metric 
does not account for industry-specific publishing practices, as some manufacturers may actively encourage academic 
publications while others focus on commercial markets. Device cost and accessibility influence publication 
frequency; lower-cost devices may appear more frequently due to broader accessibility. This metric captures only 
documented academic use and does not reflect unpublished research or clinical deployments.
