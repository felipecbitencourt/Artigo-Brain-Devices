R1C1 - RESPOSTA AOS REVISORES

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"How do the authors justify the use of the 'number of DOI-indexed publications' 
as a proxy for device adoption without normalising device age, year of market 
entry, or industry-specific publishing practices?"

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (INGLÊS):
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this important methodological concern. We acknowledge 
that the raw count of DOI-indexed publications does not account for device age, 
year of market entry, or field-specific publishing dynamics.

To address this limitation, we have implemented the following revisions:

1. **Clarification of metric purpose (Methods section):** We now explicitly 
   state that the number of DOI-indexed publications serves as an indicator of 
   documented use in the scientific literature, rather than a measure of device 
   quality or technical performance. This metric reflects research adoption 
   patterns across the neuroscience and neurorehabilitation communities.

2. **Terminology revision:** Ambiguous terms have been replaced throughout the 
   manuscript. We now consistently use "research adoption" and "literature-based 
   adoption proxy" to describe this metric, avoiding any implication of quality 
   assessment.

3. **Time-normalized analysis:** We have added a supplementary analysis 
   calculating the number of publications per year since each device's market 
   entry date. This normalization accounts for the temporal bias inherent in 
   raw publication counts and allows for fairer comparison between established 
   and recently released devices.

4. **New comparative table/figure:** We have created [Table X / Figure X] 
   presenting both:
   - Total number of DOI-indexed publications per device
   - Annualized publication rate (publications per year since market entry)
   
   This dual presentation enables readers to assess both cumulative research 
   impact and adoption velocity.

5. **Limitations paragraph:** A dedicated paragraph has been added to the 
   Limitations section explicitly acknowledging that:
   - Publication counts may be influenced by device cost and accessibility
   - Industry-specific publishing practices vary across manufacturers
   - Open-access datasets and software availability may inflate counts for 
     certain devices
   - The metric does not reflect unpublished research, industrial applications, 
     or clinical deployments outside academic contexts

--- METHODS (adicionar após descrição da busca) ---

"Research adoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications 
explicitly reporting the use of each device in experimental or clinical 
applications. This metric serves as a literature-based proxy for adoption 
within the scientific community, reflecting documented use rather than device 
quality or technical performance. To account for differences in device age, 
an annualized adoption rate was calculated by dividing the total publication 
count by the number of years since each device's market entry. This 
time-normalized metric enables comparison of adoption velocity across devices 
with different commercial histories."


--- RESULTS (adicionar nova subseção ou parágrafo) ---

"Table X presents the research adoption metrics for the identified devices. 
The Epoc X leads in total publications (n = 403, 19.30%), followed by OpenBCI 
(n = 100, 4.81%) and MindWave (n = 85, 4.06%). However, when normalized by 
years since market entry, the adoption velocity reveals different patterns: 
[incluir dados normalizados]. This time-normalized perspective highlights that 
some recently released devices exhibit higher annual adoption rates despite 
lower total counts, suggesting growing research interest in newer technologies."


--- LIMITATIONS (adicionar parágrafo) ---

"The use of DOI-indexed publication counts as a proxy for research adoption 
has inherent limitations. First, this metric does not account for industry-
specific publishing practices, as some manufacturers may actively encourage 
academic publications while others focus on commercial or clinical markets. 
Second, device cost and accessibility influence publication frequency; 
lower-cost, consumer-grade devices may appear more frequently in the 
literature due to broader accessibility, particularly in resource-limited 
research settings. Third, the availability of open-source software, datasets, 
and community support for specific devices may inflate publication counts 
independently of hardware performance. Finally, this metric captures only 
documented academic use and does not reflect unpublished research, proprietary 
industrial applications, or clinical deployments outside peer-reviewed 
contexts. Readers should interpret adoption metrics as indicators of 
documented research use rather than endorsements of device quality."

CHECKLIST DE IMPLEMENTAÇÃO:
================================================================================

[ ] 1. Adicionar texto explicativo em Methods
[ ] 2. Revisar e substituir termos ambíguos em todo o manuscrito
[ ] 3. Calcular artigos/ano para cada dispositivo (precisa de dados de lançamento)
[ ] 4. Criar tabela comparativa (total vs. anualizado)
[ ] 5. Adicionar parágrafo em Limitations
[ ] 6. Revisar Abstract se necessário
[ ] 7. Verificar consistência terminológica

================================================================================
DADOS NECESSÁRIOS PARA NORMALIZAÇÃO:
================================================================================

Para calcular a taxa anualizada, precisamos do ano de lançamento de cada 
dispositivo. Sugestão: criar uma coluna "Year of Market Entry" na tabela 
principal ou material suplementar.

Fórmula: Annual Adoption Rate = Total Publications / (2025 - Year of Entry)

Exemplo:
- Epoc X: lançado em ~2019 → 403 / 6 = 67.2 artigos/ano
- OpenBCI: lançado em ~2014 → 100 / 11 = 9.1 artigos/ano
- MindWave: lançado em ~2011 → 85 / 14 = 6.1 artigos/ano
