COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"How do the authors justify the use of the 'number of DOI-indexed publications' 
as a proxy for device adoption without normalising device age, year of market 
entry, or industry-specific publishing practices?"

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (INGLÊS):
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this important methodological concern. We acknowledge 
that the raw count of DOI-indexed publications does not account for device age, 
year of market entry, or field-specific publishing dynamics.

To address this limitation, we have implemented the following revisions:

1. **Clarification of metric purpose (Methods section):** We now explicitly 
   state that the number of DOI-indexed publications serves as an indicator of 
   documented use in the scientific literature, rather than a measure of device 
   quality or technical performance.

2. **Terminology revision:** Ambiguous terms have been replaced throughout the 
   manuscript. We now consistently use "research adoption" and "literature-based 
   adoption proxy" to describe this metric.

3. **Time-normalized analysis:** We have added an analysis calculating the 
   number of publications per year since each device's market entry date. 
   Device entry dates span from 2008 to 2025, with 92 of 96 devices (95.8%) 
   having documented market entry years.

4. **New comparative table:** Table X presents both total publications and 
   annualized publication rates. Key findings:
   
   | Device                | Year | Studies | Art./Year |
   |-----------------------|------|---------|-----------|
   | Epoc X                | 2020 | 722     | 120.33    |
   | NirSmart              | 2024 | 49      | 24.50     |
   | MindWave Mobile 2     | 2018 | 152     | 19.00     |
   | OpenBCI               | 2016 | 180     | 18.00     |
   | Flex 2                | 2023 | 54      | 18.00     |
   | NeuSen W              | 2021 | 72      | 14.40     |
   | NIRSport2             | 2018 | 61      | 7.62      |
   | Enobio                | 2008 | 108     | 6.00      |

5. **Gini coefficient analysis (R3C3):** The research adoption distribution 
   exhibits high concentration (Gini = 0.8568), indicating that a small number 
   of devices dominate the literature. The top 5 devices account for 55.4% 
   of all documented studies (1,157 of 2,087).

--- METHODS (adicionar após descrição da busca) ---

"Research adoption was quantified by the number of DOI-indexed publications 
explicitly reporting the use of each device in experimental or clinical 
applications. This metric serves as a literature-based proxy for adoption 
within the scientific community, reflecting documented use rather than device 
quality or technical performance. To account for differences in device age, 
an annualized adoption rate was calculated by dividing the total publication 
count by the number of years since each device's market entry. Market entry 
dates were available for 92 of 96 devices (95.8%), spanning from 2008 to 2025.

Release year information was not consistently disclosed by manufacturers for 
a substantial portion of the devices. Consequently, a secondary strategy 
based on the year of first appearance was adopted. This strategy integrated 
multiple indicators, including official manufacturer documentation, the 
earliest peer-reviewed publications reporting device usage, presentations 
at scientific or industry events, and, when applicable, the year of first 
clearance or approval by the relevant regulatory authority (e.g., FDA, CE 
marking), among other verifiable milestones. For devices that underwent 
subsequent updates, revisions, or new versions, the earliest identifiable 
date of public availability was considered."


--- RESULTS (adicionar nova subseção) ---

"Table X presents the research adoption metrics for the identified devices. 
The Emotiv EPOC X leads in total publications (n = 722, 19.30%), followed by 
OpenBCI Ganglion/Cyton/Daisy (n = 180, 4.81%) and NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 
(n = 152, 4.06%). When normalized by years since market entry, adoption velocity 
reveals different patterns: recently released devices such as NirSmart 
(24.50 articles/year) and Emotiv Flex 2 (18.00 articles/year) exhibit high 
annual adoption rates despite lower absolute counts, suggesting growing 
research interest in newer technologies.

The research adoption distribution is highly concentrated, with a Gini 
coefficient of 0.86. The top 5 devices by adoption velocity account for 
55.4% of all identified studies (1,157 of 2,087), while 80% of devices 
contribute less than 10% of the total literature."


--- LIMITATIONS (adicionar parágrafo) ---

"The use of DOI-indexed publication counts as a proxy for research adoption 
has inherent limitations. First, this metric does not account for industry-
specific publishing practices, as some manufacturers may actively encourage 
academic publications while others focus on commercial or clinical markets. 
Second, device cost and accessibility influence publication frequency; 
lower-cost, consumer-grade devices may appear more frequently in the 
literature due to broader accessibility, particularly in resource-limited 
research settings. Third, the availability of open-source software, datasets, 
and community support for specific devices may inflate publication counts 
independently of hardware performance. Finally, this metric captures only 
documented academic use and does not reflect unpublished research, proprietary 
industrial applications, or clinical deployments outside peer-reviewed contexts."
