R3C5 - EVOLUÇÃO TEMPORAL DO MERCADO
================================================================================
Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"The manuscript mentions devices 'currently available' but does not analyze temporal evolution. The neurotechnology 
market has evolved rapidly. Early devices (e.g., NeuroSky MindWave, 2009) differ significantly from recent models 
(e.g., Kernel Flow, 2023). Requirement: 
1. Add a timeline figure showing when each device entered the market
2. Analyze trends: 2.1. Has the average channel count increased over time? 2.2. Has the price per channel decreased 
   (Moore's Law for neurotechnology)? 2.3. When did wireless architectures become dominant?"

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We have addressed this comment by adding:

1. A timeline figure (Figure X) showing device market entry dates from 2008 to 2025, organized by technology type.

2. Trend analysis in the Results section covering:
   - Channel count evolution across four time periods
   - Price per channel trends (with discussion of selection bias in recent data)
   - Wireless architecture adoption rates (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi)

3. A discussion paragraph relating these trends to broader technological evolution.

4. Methodology explanation for determining "year of first appearance" when manufacturer disclosure was unavailable.

TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - METHODS
================================================================================

Release year information was not consistently disclosed by manufacturers for a substantial portion of the devices. 
Consequently, a secondary strategy based on the year of first appearance was adopted. This strategy integrated 
multiple indicators, including official manufacturer documentation, the earliest peer-reviewed publications 
reporting device usage, presentations at scientific or industry events, and, when applicable, the year of first 
clearance or approval by the relevant regulatory authority (e.g., FDA, CE marking), among other verifiable 
milestones. For devices that underwent subsequent updates, revisions, or new versions, the earliest identifiable 
date of public availability was considered.

Temporal Evolution of the Neurotechnology Market

Figure X presents the timeline of market entry for the 96 devices identified in this review. The commercial 
landscape has evolved substantially since the introduction of early consumer-grade EEG devices in 2008.

Market growth: Device entries accelerated markedly after 2019, with 63.6% of all identified devices (61 of 96) 
entering the market between 2019 and 2025. The distribution was: 2008-2014 (8 devices, 8.3%), 2015-2018 (23 
devices, 24.0%), 2019-2022 (35 devices, 36.5%), and 2023-2025 (26 devices, 27.1%).

Channel count trends: The average channel count increased from 24.9 (2008-2014) to 27.4 (2015-2018), before 
stabilizing around 22-24 channels (2019-2025). This pattern reflects the simultaneous growth of two market 
segments: high-density research systems (32-128+ channels) and consumer-grade devices (1-8 channels).

Price per channel: Early devices (2008-2014) averaged $108 per channel. The 2015-2018 period showed significant 
cost reduction ($69/channel) as consumer-grade devices entered the market. Contemporary pricing varies 
substantially by device category, with consumer devices achieving sub-$50 per-channel costs.

Wireless adoption: Wireless connectivity has dominated since 2015, with approximately 70% of devices featuring 
Bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth Low Energy emerged as the preferred protocol for consumer and research-grade 
devices.

TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - DISCUSSION
================================================================================

The temporal analysis reveals patterns consistent with broader technology adoption curves. The democratization 
of brain monitoring technology—characterized by market growth exceeding 60% since 2019, bifurcation into consumer 
and research segments, and near-universal wireless connectivity—mirrors trends observed in wearable electronics 
and digital health devices.
