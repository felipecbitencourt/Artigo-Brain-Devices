R3C5 - EVOLUÇÃO TEMPORAL DO MERCADO
================================================================================
Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
The manuscript mentions devices "currently available" but does not analyze temporal evolution. The neurotechnology 
market has evolved rapidly. Early devices (e.g., NeuroSky MindWave, 2009) differ significantly from recent models 
(e.g., Kernel Flow, 2023). Requirement: 1. Add a timeline figure showing when each device entered the market; 
2. Analyze trends: 2.1. Has the average channel count increased over time? 2.2. Has the price per channel 
decreased (Moore's Law for neurotechnology)? 2.3. When did wireless architectures become dominant?

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We have addressed this comment by adding:

1. A timeline figure (Figure X) showing device market entry dates from 2008 to 2025.

2. Trend analysis in the Results section covering:
   - Channel count evolution across four time periods
   - Price per channel trends
   - Wireless architecture adoption rates (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi)

3. A discussion paragraph relating these trends to broader technological evolution.

4. Methodology explanation for determining "year of first appearance" when manufacturer disclosure was unavailable.

--- Temporal Evolution of the Neurotechnology Market (R3C5) ---

Figure X presents the timeline of market entry for the 96 devices identified in this review. The commercial 
landscape has evolved substantially since the introduction of early consumer-grade EEG devices in 2008.

Market growth: Device entries accelerated markedly after 2019, with 63.6% of all identified devices (61 of 96) 
entering the market between 2019 and 2025. The distribution was: 2008-2014 (8 devices, 8.3%), 2015-2018 (23 
devices, 24.0%), 2019-2022 (35 devices, 36.5%), and 2023-2025 (26 devices, 27.1%).

--- Channel Count Evolution (R3C5) ---

The average channel count increased from 24.9 (2008-2014) to 27.4 (2015-2018), before stabilizing around 22-24 
channels (2019-2025). This pattern reflects the simultaneous growth of two market segments: high-density research 
systems (32-128+ channels) and consumer-grade devices (1-8 channels).

--- Price Per Channel (R3C5) ---

Early devices (2008-2014) averaged $108 per channel. The 2015-2018 period showed significant cost reduction 
($69/channel) as consumer-grade devices entered the market. Contemporary pricing varies substantially by device 
category, with consumer devices achieving sub-$50 per-channel costs.

--- Wireless Adoption (R3C5) ---

Wireless connectivity has dominated since 2015, with approximately 70% of devices featuring Bluetooth 
connectivity: 2008-2014 (62.5% Bluetooth, 12.5% Wi-Fi), 2015-2018 (73.9% Bluetooth, 34.8% Wi-Fi), 2019-2022 
(71.4% Bluetooth, 31.4% Wi-Fi), and 2023-2025 (69.2% Bluetooth, 19.2% Wi-Fi).

SEÇÃO: DISCUSSION
================================================================================

--- Temporal Trends (R3C5) ---

The temporal analysis reveals patterns consistent with broader technology adoption curves. The democratization of 
brain monitoring technology—characterized by market growth exceeding 60% since 2019, bifurcation into consumer and 
research segments, and near-universal wireless connectivity—mirrors trends observed in wearable electronics and 
digital health devices.
