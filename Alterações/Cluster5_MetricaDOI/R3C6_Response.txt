R3C6 - TRATAMENTO DE VARIANTES NA ANÁLISE
================================================================================

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"The manuscript states '125 models and variants' but does not explain how 
variants were handled in the analysis. If a study used 'Epoc' (2009) and 
another used 'Epoc X' (2018), were these counted separately or aggregated? 
Clarify the aggregation strategy."

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (INGLÊS):
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this important methodological question. We have 
added a clarifying paragraph in the Methods section explaining our 
variant handling strategy.

**Variant Handling Strategy:**

Device variants were handled using a hybrid approach:

1. **Catalog level (96 devices):** Unique device families were identified 
   based on manufacturer naming conventions and shared core architecture. 
   For example, "Emotiv EPOC/EPOC+/EPOC X" was counted as one device 
   family in the primary catalog.

2. **Specification level (125 entries):** When variants exhibited 
   distinct technical specifications (e.g., different channel counts, 
   electrode configurations, or wireless protocols), they were recorded 
   as separate entries in the technical specification tables. This 
   resulted in 125 total entries from 96 unique device families.

3. **Bibliometric level:** Publication counts were aggregated at the 
   device family level to avoid artificial fragmentation of adoption 
   metrics. Studies mentioning "EPOC," "EPOC+," or "EPOC X" were 
   attributed to the Emotiv EPOC family. This approach was chosen 
   because:
   - Many publications do not specify the exact variant used
   - Core hardware architecture often remains similar across variants
   - Aggregation provides a more stable indicator of manufacturer/device 
     adoption patterns

**Justification:**

This hybrid strategy balances two competing goals:
- **Technical granularity:** Capturing specification differences between 
  variants (e.g., EPOC X has improved reference system and motion sensors)
- **Bibliometric stability:** Avoiding fragmented citation counts that 
  would make comparison across device families unreliable

For devices with major hardware revisions that represent distinct 
generations (e.g., Muse 2014 vs Muse 2 2018), publication searches were 
designed to capture all generations, with aggregated counts reported at 
the product line level.

Device Variant Handling

The 96 identified devices correspond to unique device families based on 
manufacturer naming conventions and core hardware architecture. When 
manufacturers offered multiple variants with distinct technical 
specifications (e.g., different channel configurations or electrode 
types), these were recorded as separate entries in the technical 
specification tables, resulting in 125 total catalog entries.

For bibliometric analysis, publication counts were aggregated at the 
device family level. Studies mentioning any variant of a device family 
(e.g., "Emotiv EPOC," "EPOC+," or "EPOC X") were attributed to the 
corresponding device family. This aggregation strategy was adopted 
because many publications do not specify the exact variant used, and 
aggregation provides more stable adoption indicators across device 
families.

CHECKLIST DE IMPLEMENTAÇÃO:
================================================================================

[ ] 1. Adicionar parágrafo em Methods sobre tratamento de variantes
[ ] 2. Verificar consistência com tabela (96 vs 125)
[ ] 3. Confirmar que supplementary material lista todas as variantes
[ ] 4. Ajustar texto se estratégia diferente foi usada

================================================================================
NOTA:
================================================================================

Este texto assume que a estratégia descrita foi a adotada. Se a metodologia 
real foi diferente, ajustar o texto de acordo.
