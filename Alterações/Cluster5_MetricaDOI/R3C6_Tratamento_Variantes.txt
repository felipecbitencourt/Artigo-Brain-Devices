COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"The manuscript states '125 models and variants' but does not explain how variants were handled in the analysis. 
If a study used 'Epoc' (2009) and another used 'Epoc X' (2018), were these counted separately or aggregated? 
Clarify the aggregation strategy."

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this important methodological question. We have added a paragraph in Methods explaining:

1. Grouping criterion: Devices were organized based on form factor (device type), not just model name.

2. Aggregation logic: Same type + minor variations → grouped; different type → separated.

3. Bibliometric justification: Many publications do not specify the exact variant, supporting aggregation at 
   device family level.

Device Variant Handling

Devices were organized based on form factor (device type) as the primary grouping criterion. Within the same 
manufacturer, devices sharing identical form factors but differing in channel count or minor configurations were 
grouped as variants within a single entry (e.g., "Quick 20m | 20r v2 | 32r" representing the same headset design 
with 20, 21, or 32 channels). Conversely, devices with fundamentally different form factors were recorded as 
separate entries, even from the same manufacturer (e.g., CGX Cognionics "Quick" headset vs. "Mobile" cap).

This aggregation strategy was also adopted because many publications do not specify the exact variant used. 
Authors frequently report using "Emotiv EPOC" or "OpenBCI" without distinguishing specific models or 
configurations. Aggregating at the device family level provides more stable adoption indicators and avoids 
artificial fragmentation of citation counts.

EXEMPLOS:
================================================================================

Variantes agrupadas (mesmo Type):
- Quick 20m | 20r v2 | 32r (Headset) - diferem em nº de canais
- DSI 7 | 24 (Headset) - diferem em 7 ou 24 canais
- Flex 2 Saline | Gel (Cap) - diferem apenas no eletrodo

Dispositivos separados (Types diferentes):
- CGX: Quick (Headset) ≠ Mobile (Cap) ≠ Patch EEG (Adhesive)
- Bitbrain: Versatile (Cap) ≠ Diadem (Headset)
