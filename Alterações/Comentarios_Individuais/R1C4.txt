RESOLVIDO - claudio 
Could the authors clarify how latency, jitter, and throughput, which are discussed conceptually in the 
context, could be quantitatively integrated into the comparative framework to support real-time or 
closed-loop applications? 
 
1. Explicar de forma simples: 1. O que é latência; 2. Por que ela é importante para BCI e 
neurofeedback. 
2. Classificar os dispositivos em: 1. Adequados para tempo real; 2. Potencialmente adequados; 3. 
Não adequados. 
3. Criar uma tabela com essa classificação. 
4. Relacionar explicitamente com aplicações em loop fechado.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS 
We thank the reviewer for this important comment. As device-specific numerical values for latency, jitter, 
and wireless throughput are rarely disclosed and are highly configuration-dependent, they could not be 
directly compared across devices. Instead, these parameters were quantitatively integrated into the 
comparative framework using protocol- and data-rate–based proxies. Throughput was inferred from 
channel count and nominal sampling rate, while latency and jitter were contextualized according to the 
wireless communication protocol. 
 
This proxy-based operationalization was incorporated into Table 1 through the addition of a “Closed-loop 
readiness (proxy-based)” column, classifying devices as Low, Medium, or High in terms of suitability for 
real-time 
and 
closed-loop 
applications. 
This 
approach 
enables 
a 
systematic comparison of 
transmission-related performance trade-offs and reflects timing and bandwidth constraints relevant to 
closed-loop applications, such as real-time neurofeedback, adaptive BCI control, and event-locked 
multimodal synchronization, without implying regulatory certification or guaranteed real-time 
performance.
