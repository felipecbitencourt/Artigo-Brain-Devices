RESOLVIDO - claudio   
The current contribution is ambiguous. The manuscript does not articulate what is new beyond other 
published surveys (e.g., wireless EEG surveys, multimodal neurotech reviews). 
 
1. O que exatamente este artigo faz que outros surveys não fazem? 
2. Em que dimensão ele é diferente (escopo, método, dados, resultado)? 
3. Por que ele não é “apenas mais um survey de EEG wireless / multimodal”?

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS 
We thank the reviewer for this important comment. To clarify the novelty of the contribution, we revised the 
Introduction to explicitly contrast this work with existing wireless EEG and multimodal neurotechnology 
surveys. While prior reviews typically focus on signal processing methods, experimental paradigms, or 
limited subsets of devices, the present study provides a large-scale, device-level mapping of commercially 
available EEG and fNIRS systems. The revised text highlights the unique integration of technical 
specifications, 
application-oriented 
criteria 
(including 
proxy-based 
closed-loop 
readiness 
and

synchronization support), and bibliometric indicators of device adoption, thereby clarifying the distinct 
contribution of this review.
