R3C4.  
PARCIALMENTE RESOLVIDO - claudio 
The abstract mentions "a significant gap between consumer-grade and research-grade technologies" but 
does not define these categories. Is the classification based on price, signal quality (SNR), regulatory 
approval (FDA Class II), or intended use? Requirement: 1. Provide explicit criteria for this classification. For 
example: 1.1. Consumer-grade: < $500, < 8 channels, dry electrodes, primarily marketed for 
meditation/gaming; 1.2. Research-grade: > $5,000, > 32 channels, wet/gel electrodes, medical-grade 
certification. 
 
1. Criar critérios explícitos em Methods ou Results: 
2. Aplicar essa classificação de forma consistente. 
3. Ajustar o Abstract para refletir essa definição. 
4. Inserir na tabela a classificação “Grade: consumer / research / clinical” 
→ Onde: Methods, Results, Abstract 
 
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS 
We have added an explicit definitional paragraph clarifying that the classification of EEG devices is based on 
intended use, technical specifications, signal quality, and regulatory status. This paragraph was placed 
before the detailed technical comparison to improve conceptual clarity and directly address the reviewer’s 
concern. This classification framework is supported by prior studies distinguishing consumer-grade, 
research-grade, and clinical-grade EEG systems based on these criteria (Chuang and Lin, 2019; Doudou et 
al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Grasso-Cladera et al., 2023).
