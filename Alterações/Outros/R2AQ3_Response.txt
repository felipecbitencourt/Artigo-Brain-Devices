R2AQ3 - ROADMAP FUTURO E REFERÊNCIAS RECENTES
================================================================================

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner? Several major 
domains are missing: no inclusion of 2023-2025 state-of-the-art advances 
(e.g., EEG-transformers, multimodal AI, federated EEG learning, biosignal 
foundation models), limited discussion of translational pathways, no 
roadmap or identification of future research gaps."

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (INGLÊS):
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this observation. While the primary focus of 
this scoping review is device-level technical characterization rather 
than signal processing algorithms, we have expanded the Future 
Directions section to address emerging computational approaches and 
provide a clearer research roadmap.

The following additions have been made:

1. **Recent technological advances (2023-2025):** A brief paragraph 
   acknowledges the rapid evolution of computational methods for 
   biosignal analysis, including transformer-based architectures, 
   foundation models for EEG/fNIRS, and federated learning approaches.

2. **Device-algorithm relationship:** We clarify that hardware 
   characteristics (channel count, sampling rate, data access) directly 
   influence the applicability of advanced algorithms, establishing 
   a clear link between the device review and computational frontiers.

3. **Translational pathways:** The Clinical, Industrial, and Societal 
   Deployment Pathways subsection (R2C9) addresses translational 
   considerations including regulatory requirements, cost barriers, 
   and clinical integration challenges.

4. **Research roadmap:** The Future Directions now includes a structured 
   agenda for subsequent research.

Relation to Emerging Computational Approaches

The devices characterized in this review serve as the hardware foundation 
for emerging computational approaches in neurotechnology. Recent advances 
in deep learning architectures, particularly transformer-based models 
adapted for EEG analysis (Eldele et al., 2024; Song et al., 2023), and 
the development of foundation models for biosignal processing (Liu et 
al., 2024) represent promising frontiers for brain monitoring applications.

However, the applicability of these advanced methods depends critically 
on hardware capabilities. High-channel-count devices with adequate 
sampling rates and open data access protocols are prerequisites for 
training and deploying complex neural network architectures. Consumer-
grade devices with limited channels may be better suited for lightweight 
models optimized for edge computing, while research-grade systems 
enable the full potential of deep learning approaches.

Federated learning represents another emerging paradigm relevant to 
portable brain monitoring devices (Li et al., 2024). As these devices 
are increasingly used outside laboratory settings, privacy-preserving 
approaches that enable model training across distributed datasets 
without centralizing sensitive neural data become essential. Future 
work should evaluate device suitability for federated learning 
deployments, considering local processing capabilities, connectivity 
requirements, and data sovereignty constraints.

Research Roadmap

Based on the findings of this review and the identification of gaps in 
the current literature, we propose the following research agenda:

1. **Short-term (1-2 years):**
   - Experimental benchmarking studies comparing signal quality, noise 
     profiles, and reliability across device categories
   - Standardized reporting frameworks for neurotechnology specifications
   - Validation studies for consumer-grade devices in clinical screening

2. **Medium-term (3-5 years):**
   - Integration of adaptive AI algorithms with portable brain monitoring
   - Multi-center validation of devices for neurorehabilitation outcomes
   - Regulatory pathway development for AI-enhanced neurotechnology

3. **Long-term (5+ years):**
   - Closed-loop brain-computer interfaces using portable devices
   - Population-level neurosurveillance using federated learning
   - Personalized brain health monitoring ecosystems
