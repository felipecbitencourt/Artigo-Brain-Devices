SEÇÃO: INTRODUCTION
SUBTÍTULO: Research Context
RESPONDE A: R2C1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite their growing potential, selecting the most appropriate brain monitoring device remains a major challenge. 
The commercial landscape has expanded rapidly, with 96 devices from 64 manufacturers across 26 countries 
currently available. This diversity, coupled with the absence of standardized reporting, creates a paradox of 
choice that complicates decision-making for researchers and clinicians.

SEÇÃO: INTRODUCTION
SUBTÍTULO: Research Question
RESPONDE A: R2C1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This scoping review addresses the following research question: How can commercially available portable EEG and 
fNIRS devices be systematically characterized and compared to support informed selection for neuroscience and 
neurorehabilitation research?

Rather than testing a hypothesis, this study provides an evidence-based framework that bridges engineering 
specifications and practical research implementation.

SEÇÃO: DISCUSSION
SUBTÍTULO: Deployment Pathways
RESPONDE A: R2C9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The implications of this review extend beyond academic research to clinical, industrial, and societal contexts. 
From a clinical perspective, the increasing availability of medical-grade certified devices (7.3% of the 
identified devices) suggests a maturing pathway toward regulatory-approved neurotechnology deployments. 
Consumer-grade devices (42.7%) offer opportunities for preventive neurology, mental wellness monitoring, and 
tele-neurorehabilitation, though clinical validation remains essential.

Industrial deployment pathways include workplace cognitive monitoring, driver alertness systems, and human-machine 
interface optimization. The dominance of wireless architectures (approximately 70% Bluetooth adoption) facilitates 
integration into existing occupational health infrastructures.

Societal implications include accessibility and equity considerations. The price range observed ($97 to $25,000) 
reflects significant heterogeneity, with consumer-grade devices potentially democratizing access to brain 
monitoring technologies in resource-limited settings.

SEÇÃO: FUTURE DIRECTIONS
SUBTÍTULO: Emerging Technologies
RESPONDE A: R2AQ3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several emerging technologies are likely to reshape the portable neurotechnology landscape:

Artificial Intelligence Integration: The integration of machine learning pipelines directly into device firmware 
represents a critical frontier. On-device inference, adaptive algorithms, and real-time classification are 
increasingly enabled by advances in edge computing and neuromorphic processing.

Foundation Models: Large-scale pre-trained models for EEG analysis (e.g., EEGNet variants, Transformer-based 
architectures) may standardize signal processing approaches across devices and applications.

Federated Learning: Privacy-preserving distributed learning approaches enable multi-site neurotechnology research 
without centralized data sharing, addressing regulatory and ethical constraints.

Multimodal Integration: The convergence of EEG, fNIRS, and other biosignals (PPG, GSR, IMU) in single devices 
enables comprehensive physiological monitoring for brain-body interface applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEÇÃO: FUTURE DIRECTIONS
SUBTÍTULO: Research Priorities
RESPONDE A: R2AQ3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future research should prioritize: (1) standardized benchmarking protocols for cross-device validation; 
(2) clinical translation studies in neurorehabilitation settings; (3) longitudinal market surveillance to track 
technological evolution; and (4) development of reporting standards for neurotechnology specifications.
