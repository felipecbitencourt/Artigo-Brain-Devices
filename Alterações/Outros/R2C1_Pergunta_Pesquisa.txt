COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"The introduction should include an explicit research question."

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have:

1. Added explicit research question in the Introduction.
2. Framed the scoping review objective clearly.
3. Distinguished from hypothesis-testing studies.

TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Despite their growing potential, selecting the most appropriate brain monitoring device remains a major challenge. 
The commercial landscape has expanded rapidly, with 96 devices from 64 manufacturers across 26 countries 
currently available. This diversity, coupled with the absence of standardized reporting, creates a paradox of 
choice that complicates decision-making for researchers and clinicians.

This scoping review addresses the following research question: How can commercially available portable EEG and 
fNIRS devices be systematically characterized and compared to support informed selection for neuroscience and 
neurorehabilitation research?

Rather than testing a hypothesis, this study provides an evidence-based framework that bridges engineering 
specifications and practical research implementation.
