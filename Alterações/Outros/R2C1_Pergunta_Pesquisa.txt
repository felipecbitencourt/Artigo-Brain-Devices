COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"The introduction should include an explicit research question."

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have revised the Introduction to 
explicitly state the research question: "How can commercially available portable 
EEG and fNIRS devices be systematically characterized to support informed selection 
for neuroscience and neurorehabilitation research?" The framing now connects 
the practical challenge of device selection to the scoping review objective.

Accordingly, this review addresses the following research question: How can 
commercially available portable EEG and fNIRS devices be systematically
