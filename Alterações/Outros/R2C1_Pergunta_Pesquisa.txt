R2C1 - PERGUNTA DE PESQUISA

Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
The Introduction effectively contextualizes EEG/fNIRS relevance, but the research problem is not tightly framed. 
The text implies lack of standardization and difficulty selecting devices but does not explicitly state the 
research question nor hypothesis.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have revised the Introduction to 
explicitly state the research question: "How can commercially available portable 
EEG and fNIRS devices be systematically characterized to support informed selection 
for neuroscience and neurorehabilitation research?" The framing now connects 
the practical challenge of device selection to the scoping review objective.

--- Research Context (R2C1) ---

Accordingly, this review addresses the following research question: How can 
commercially available portable EEG and fNIRS devices be systematically 
characterized to support informed selection for neuroscience and 
neurorehabilitation research?
