Atualizado: 2026-01-12

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
It may be beneficial to include a section titled "Clinical, Industrial, and Societal Deployment Pathways," where 
potential deployment scenarios and their constraints are discussed.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added a Discussion paragraph addressing:

1. Clinical pathways: Medical-grade certification trends, tele-neurorehabilitation potential.
2. Industrial pathways: Workplace monitoring, driver alertness, human-machine interfaces.
3. Societal implications: Accessibility, equity, price heterogeneity across device categories.

SEÇÃO: DISCUSSION
================================================================================

--- Deployment Pathways (R2C9) ---

The implications of this review extend beyond academic research to clinical, industrial, and societal contexts. 
From a clinical perspective, the increasing availability of medical-grade certified devices (7.3% of the 
identified devices) suggests a maturing pathway toward regulatory-approved neurotechnology deployments. 
Consumer-grade devices (42.7%) offer opportunities for preventive neurology, mental wellness monitoring, and 
tele-neurorehabilitation, though clinical validation remains essential.

Industrial deployment pathways include workplace cognitive monitoring, driver alertness systems, and human-machine 
interface optimization. The dominance of wireless architectures (approximately 70% Bluetooth adoption) facilitates 
integration into existing occupational health infrastructures.

Societal implications include accessibility and equity considerations. The price range observed ($97 to $25,000) 
reflects significant heterogeneity, with consumer-grade devices potentially democratizing access to brain 
monitoring technologies in resource-limited settings.
