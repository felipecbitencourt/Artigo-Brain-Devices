COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
It may be beneficial to include a section titled “Clinical, Industrial, and Societal Deployment Pathways,” 
where potential deployment scenarios and their constraints are discussed.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In response, we have added a new subsection 
titled “Clinical, Industrial, and Societal Deployment Pathways” to the Discussion. This 
subsection outlines how EEG and fNIRS technologies may be deployed in clinical, industrial, 
and societal contexts, highlighting key use cases, such as diagnostic support, workplace 
monitoring, and community-based applications, together with the main constraints, including
regulatory requirements, system integration, data privacy, digital literacy, and sustainability of 
support.

Clinical, Industrial, and Societal Deployment Pathways

Beyond the characterization of devices in academic research contexts, it is relevant 
to discuss how these technologies may be deployed in clinical, industrial, and societal 
settings, as well as the constraints that shape their use.

From a clinical perspective, the presence of only a small subset of regulatory-certified 
devices among the systems analyzed indicates that only a fraction of currently available 
portable technologies meets the safety, reliability, and standardization requirements for 
medical use. These devices are better suited for applications such as diagnostic support 
(e.g., epilepsy monitoring or assessment of cortical activity in neurological disorders), 
therapy monitoring, and closed-loop neurorehabilitation, in which brain signals are used 
to guide or adapt interventions in real time. However, clinical deployment remains constrained
by lengthy regulatory approval processes, challenges in integrating devices with hospital
information systems, and the need for trained clinical personnel to operate and interpret 
these technologies. Consumer-grade devices, while not intended for diagnostic use, open 
complementary pathways for mental wellness monitoring, home-based neurorehabilitation, and 
telemedicine, provided that their outputs are interpreted cautiously and, when necessary, 
benchmarked against clinical-grade references.

Industrial deployment pathways include workplace cognitive monitoring for fatigue and attention, 
alertness systems for operators and drivers (for example, in road, rail, or aviation contexts), 
and the optimization of human–machine interaction in safety-critical environments. In this domain,
the adoption of wireless and wearable architectures, together with the increasing availability of 
dry or semi-dry sensors, facilitates integration into operational settings, enabling continuous and 
unobtrusive monitoring during real-world tasks. At the same time, industrial deployment faces important
constraints related to data privacy, worker consent, and the difficulty of defining reliable 
criteria for interpreting brain signals consistently across individuals, tasks, and environments.

At the societal level, deployment pathways are shaped by issues of accessibility and equity. 
The wide range of device prices and technical sophistication observed in this review reflects
a market in which high-end research systems coexist with low-cost consumer devices. This diversity
creates opportunities for educational use (e.g., classroom-based neuroscience labs and student projects), 
community-based research (such as participatory data collection in local health or cognition studies), 
and technology-assisted wellness in resource-limited settings (including stress monitoring and basic 
neurofeedback in schools or community clinics). However, equitable adoption depends
not only on affordability but also on overcoming digital literacy barriers, providing 
culturally appropriate and usable interfaces, and establishing ongoing support models that 
include training, maintenance, and assistance with data interpretation beyond the initial 
purchase of the device.
