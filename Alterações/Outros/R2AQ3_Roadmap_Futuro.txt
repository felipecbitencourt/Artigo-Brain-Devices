RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have expanded Future Directions to include:

1. AI integration: On-device inference, adaptive algorithms, real-time classification.
2. Foundation models: Large-scale pre-trained models for EEG analysis.
3. Federated learning: Privacy-preserving distributed approaches.
4. Multimodal integration: EEG + fNIRS + biosignals convergence.
5. Specific research priorities: Benchmarking, clinical translation, longitudinal surveillance, reporting 
   standards.

TEXTO PARA MANUSCRITO - FUTURE DIRECTIONS
================================================================================

Emerging Technologies and Research Roadmap

Several emerging technologies are likely to reshape the portable neurotechnology landscape:

Artificial Intelligence Integration: The integration of machine learning pipelines directly into device firmware 
represents a critical frontier. On-device inference, adaptive algorithms, and real-time classification are 
increasingly enabled by advances in edge computing and neuromorphic processing.

Foundation Models: Large-scale pre-trained models for EEG analysis (e.g., EEGNet variants, Transformer-based 
architectures) may standardize signal processing approaches across devices and applications.

Federated Learning: Privacy-preserving distributed learning approaches enable multi-site neurotechnology research 
without centralized data sharing, addressing regulatory and ethical constraints.

Multimodal Integration: The convergence of EEG, fNIRS, and other biosignals (PPG, GSR, IMU) in single devices 
enables comprehensive physiological monitoring for brain-body interface applications.

Future research should prioritize: (1) standardized benchmarking protocols for cross-device validation; 
(2) clinical translation studies in neurorehabilitation settings; (3) longitudinal market surveillance to track 
technological evolution; and (4) development of reporting standards for neurotechnology specifications.
