================================================================================

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"It may be beneficial to include a section titled 'Clinical, Industrial, and 
Societal Deployment Pathways,' where potential deployment scenarios and their 
constraints are discussed."

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (INGLÊS):
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. A new subsection titled 
"Clinical, Industrial, and Societal Deployment Pathways" has been added to 
the Discussion section. This subsection addresses potential deployment 
scenarios for portable brain monitoring devices and discusses the constraints 
associated with each context.

The new subsection covers:

1. **Clinical deployment:** Regulatory requirements, certification pathways 
   (FDA, CE marking), and integration into hospital workflows
   
2. **Hospital and institutional barriers:** Infrastructure requirements, 
   staff training, data management, and interoperability with electronic 
   health records

3. **Cost and accessibility considerations:** Price stratification across 
   device categories and implications for resource-limited settings

4. **Industrial and research applications:** Integration into occupational 
   health monitoring, human factors research, and neuroergonomics

5. **Societal implications:** Consumer-grade devices for wellness and 
   self-monitoring, ethical considerations, and data privacy

Clinical, Industrial, and Societal Deployment Pathways

The translation of portable brain monitoring devices from research settings 
to clinical, industrial, and societal contexts involves distinct deployment 
pathways, each with specific requirements and constraints.

**Clinical Deployment**

Clinical adoption of EEG and fNIRS devices requires regulatory certification 
appropriate to the intended use. In the United States, devices intended for 
diagnostic or therapeutic purposes must obtain FDA clearance, typically 
under Class II medical device regulations. In Europe, CE marking under the 
Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is required. Many consumer-grade and 
research-grade devices identified in this review lack such certifications, 
limiting their use to research or wellness applications rather than clinical 
diagnosis or treatment planning.

Hospital integration presents additional challenges. Clinical-grade systems 
must interface with electronic health record (EHR) systems, comply with 
data security standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and fit within established 
clinical workflows. Staff training requirements vary considerably: 
consumer-grade devices with dry electrodes may require minimal training, 
while high-density gel-based systems demand specialized expertise. Devices 
such as the g.Nautilus and Enobio, which combine research-grade signal 
quality with regulatory pathways, represent potential bridges between 
research validation and clinical implementation.

**Institutional and Hospital Barriers**

Beyond regulatory requirements, institutional barriers influence device 
adoption. Infrastructure requirements include dedicated space for signal 
acquisition, electromagnetic shielding in some settings, and IT support 
for data management. The cost of clinical-grade systems (often exceeding 
$20,000–50,000 for high-density configurations) represents a significant 
barrier for many institutions, particularly in low- and middle-income 
countries. Consumer-grade devices priced below $1,000 offer accessibility 
but may sacrifice signal quality and regulatory compliance.

Interoperability remains a challenge. While some devices support 
standardized data export formats (EDF, BDF) and synchronization protocols 
(LSL, TCP), others rely on proprietary software ecosystems that limit 
integration with existing clinical or research infrastructure.

**Industrial and Occupational Applications**

Portable brain monitoring devices are increasingly deployed in industrial 
contexts, including occupational health monitoring, driver drowsiness 
detection, and human factors research. Devices with robust wireless 
connectivity, long battery life, and minimal setup requirements (e.g., 
Muse, Dreem, MyndBand) are particularly suited to field deployment. 
Neuroergonomics applications in aviation, transportation, and manufacturing 
benefit from lightweight, headband-style devices that minimize interference 
with work tasks.

**Societal and Consumer Applications**

The proliferation of consumer-grade EEG devices has enabled new societal 
applications, including meditation and wellness monitoring, sleep 
assessment, and personal neurofeedback training. Devices such as the Muse 
headband and NeuroSky MindWave have achieved significant market penetration 
in the wellness and personal development sectors. However, the scientific 
validity of consumer-grade neurofeedback applications remains debated, and 
users should be informed about the limitations of such devices compared to 
research- or clinical-grade systems.

Data privacy and ethical considerations are particularly relevant in 
consumer contexts. Brain data represents sensitive biometric information, 
and the collection, storage, and potential commercialization of neural 
signals raise concerns regarding informed consent, data ownership, and 
algorithmic transparency. Regulatory frameworks for neural data protection 
are still emerging, and researchers, manufacturers, and policymakers must 
collaboratively address these challenges as neurotechnology adoption 
expands beyond traditional research and clinical settings.

VERSÃO RESUMIDA (~300 palavras):
================================================================================

Clinical, Industrial, and Societal Deployment Pathways

Clinical adoption requires regulatory certification (FDA, CE marking), with 
many consumer- and research-grade devices lacking approval for diagnostic 
use. Hospital integration demands EHR compatibility, data security 
compliance, and staff training. Devices like g.Nautilus and Enobio bridge 
research validation and clinical implementation through combined signal 
quality and regulatory pathways.

Institutional barriers include infrastructure requirements, cost (>$20,000 
for high-density clinical systems), and interoperability challenges. 
Consumer-grade devices (<$1,000) improve accessibility but may compromise 
signal quality.

Industrial applications include occupational health monitoring, driver 
drowsiness detection, and neuroergonomics. Lightweight, wireless devices 
with minimal setup (Muse, Dreem) suit field deployment.

Consumer applications encompass wellness monitoring, sleep assessment, and 
personal neurofeedback. Data privacy and ethical considerations are 
critical, as brain data represents sensitive biometric information requiring 
appropriate regulatory frameworks.
