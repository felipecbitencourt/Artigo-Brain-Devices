R2C6 - RESPOSTA AOS REVISORES
================================================================================

COMENTÁRIO DO REVISOR:
"Add a 'Limitations & Future Work' section."

================================================================================
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (INGLÊS):
================================================================================

We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. A dedicated "Limitations and 
Future Directions" section has been added at the end of the manuscript, 
positioned before the Conclusion. This section explicitly addresses the 
methodological constraints of the current review and outlines opportunities 
for future research.

The new section includes:

1. **Limitations:**
   - Absence of experimental benchmarking or signal quality validation
   - Reliance on manufacturer-provided specifications without independent 
     verification
   - No direct clinical evaluation or patient-based assessment
   - Publication-based adoption metrics may not reflect real-world usage
   - Temporal limitations regarding device availability and market changes

2. **Future Directions:**
   - Experimental benchmarking studies comparing signal quality, noise 
     profiles, and reliability across devices
   - Integration with artificial intelligence and machine learning pipelines
   - Clinical validation studies in neurorehabilitation settings
   - Longitudinal tracking of device adoption and technological evolution
   - Development of standardized reporting frameworks for neurotechnology 
     specifications

Limitations and Future Directions

This scoping review has several limitations that should be acknowledged. 
First, the study did not include experimental benchmarking or direct 
signal quality validation. Device specifications were compiled from 
manufacturer documentation, technical manuals, and secondary literature, 
rather than from independent laboratory testing. As a result, reported 
parameters such as sampling rate, resolution, and wireless performance 
reflect manufacturer claims and may not fully represent real-world 
performance under varying conditions.

Second, the reliance on manufacturer-provided data introduces potential 
bias, as specifications may be optimized for marketing purposes rather 
than scientific transparency. Parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, 
latency, and impedance are rarely disclosed in standardized formats, 
limiting direct cross-device comparisons.

Third, no direct clinical evaluation was performed. The review focused 
on technical characterization and research adoption patterns rather than 
therapeutic efficacy or patient outcomes. Clinical applicability should 
be inferred cautiously, and device selection for clinical use requires 
additional validation beyond the scope of this review.

Fourth, the use of DOI-indexed publication counts as an adoption proxy 
has inherent limitations. This metric captures documented academic use 
but does not account for unpublished research, proprietary industrial 
applications, or clinical deployments outside peer-reviewed contexts. 
Additionally, publication frequency may be influenced by device cost, 
accessibility, and manufacturer support rather than technical merit.

Finally, the neurotechnology market evolves rapidly. Devices included 
in this review reflect commercial availability as of August 2025, and 
new products, firmware updates, or discontinued models may alter the 
landscape in subsequent years.

Future research should address these limitations through several 
complementary approaches. First, experimental benchmarking studies 
are needed to systematically compare signal quality, noise spectral 
profiles, dropout rates, and operational reliability across devices 
under controlled conditions. Such studies would provide empirical 
evidence to complement manufacturer specifications.

Second, the integration of brain monitoring devices with artificial 
intelligence and machine learning pipelines represents a critical 
frontier. Future work should evaluate device compatibility with 
real-time classification algorithms, adaptive neurofeedback systems, 
and closed-loop brain-computer interfaces.

Third, clinical validation studies in neurorehabilitation settings 
are essential to assess the translational potential of portable 
neurotechnologies. Prospective trials evaluating therapeutic outcomes, 
patient comfort, and long-term usability would strengthen the 
evidence base for clinical adoption.

Fourth, longitudinal tracking of device adoption and technological 
evolution would enable trend analysis and inform predictions about 
future market developments. This could include tracking firmware 
updates, software ecosystem growth, and shifts in research community 
preferences.

Finally, the development of standardized reporting frameworks for 
neurotechnology specifications would enhance transparency and 
facilitate cross-study comparisons. Industry-wide adoption of 
minimum reporting standards, similar to those established in other 
biomedical domains, would benefit both researchers and clinicians 
in making informed device selection decisions.

Limitations and Future Directions

This review has several limitations. First, no experimental benchmarking 
was performed; specifications were compiled from manufacturer sources 
rather than independent testing. Second, manufacturer-provided data may 
introduce bias, as parameters are not standardized across devices. Third, 
no clinical evaluation was conducted; the focus was on technical 
characterization rather than therapeutic efficacy. Fourth, publication-
based adoption metrics do not capture unpublished or industrial use. 
Finally, the rapidly evolving market may render some findings outdated.

Future research should include: (1) experimental benchmarking comparing 
signal quality and reliability across devices; (2) integration with AI 
and machine learning for real-time applications; (3) clinical validation 
studies in neurorehabilitation; (4) longitudinal tracking of market 
evolution; and (5) development of standardized reporting frameworks for 
neurotechnology specifications.
